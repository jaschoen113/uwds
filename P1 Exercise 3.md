#P1 Exercise 3: Starting a Formal Draft

Due 9/20
Two paragraphs and a scaffolding (~600 words)
Bring hardcopy to class

1. Re-read your exploratory draft. Identify and underline what you think your primary **claim** is (if you haven't yet reached a claim you are satisfied with, identify a claim that you think you can develop further). Then star **individual points** that support your claim and bracket any **evidence** supporting those points.

2. Make a **scaffolding**, or outline, of those points and their corresponding evidence. Try to order to the points logically, building them up to your larger claim. An example scaffolding might look something like:

Primary Claim
I. Point 1
  i. evidence
  ii. analysis of evidence
II. Point 2
  i. evidence
  ii. analysis of evidence
III. Point 3
  i. evidence
  ii. analysis of evidence

This is a very basic outline and your structure might look very different. But the key here is to keep your scaffolding down to the basics; you shouldn't be simply transferring your draft into outline form. You don't need to write full sentences, in fact you should try to extract your main points as succinctly as possible so you can compare them side-by-side and think about their relation to each other.

3. Pick **two points** and develop them into **two separate formal paragraphs**. Try to begin each paragraph with **topic sentence**--state what you will prove in this paragraph and how it connects to your larger claim. Then move into your **evidence**, quoting or paraphrase from the text. Finally **analyze** your evidence and **connect** your takeaway to your larger claim.
