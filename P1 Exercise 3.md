#P1 Exercise 3: Start a Formal Draft

Due Tuesday 9/20  
Two paragraphs and an outline (~600 words)  
Bring hardcopy to class

1. Re-read your exploratory draft. As you read, identify and underline your **interpretive problem=** and your corresponding **claim** is (if you haven't yet reached a problem or claim you are satisfied with, identify one that you think you can develop further). Identify **individual points** that support your claim and any **evidence** supporting those points. If there's any section (sentence, paragraph, etc) that you don't think should be transferred to your next draft, then you don't need to annotate it.

2. Make an **outline** of these points and their corresponding evidence. Try to order the points logically, building them up to your larger claim. An example outline might look something like:

  Primary Claim  
  I. Point 1  
    i. evidence  
    ii. analysis of evidence  
  II. Point 2  
    i. evidence  
    ii. analysis of evidence  
  III. Point 3  
    i. evidence  
    ii. analysis of evidence

  This is a very basic outline and your structure might look very different. But the key here is to keep your outline down to the basics; you shouldn't be simply transferring your draft into outline form. You don't need to write full sentences, in fact you should try to extract your main points as succinctly as possible. This will allow you to compare points side-by-side and think about their relation to each other. Feel free to bring in any new points, evidence, or analyses that you didn't have in your exploratory draft.

3. Pick **two points** and develop them into **two separate formal paragraphs**. Write a **topic sentence** (state what you will prove in this paragraph and how this connects to your larger claim). In a final draft, you might not have such deliberate topic sentences at the beginning of your paragraphs (it may make more sense, for example, to have a transitional sentence between paragraphs, and to build to your final point at the end of the paragraph). But regardless, it helps to identify the purpose of each paragraph, even if just for yourself, before you begin. Then move into your **evidence**, quoting or paraphrasing from the text. Finally **analyze** your evidence and **connect** your takeaway to your larger claim.
