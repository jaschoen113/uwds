#P1 Exercise 3: Start a Formal Draft

Due Tuesday 9/20
Two paragraphs and an outline (~600 words)
Bring hardcopy to class

1. Re-read your exploratory draft. As you read, identify and underline what you think your primary **claim** is (if you haven't yet reached a claim you are satisfied with, identify a claim that you think you can develop further). Identify **individual points** that support your claim and any **evidence** supporting those points. If there's any section (sentence, paragraph, etc) that you don't think should be transferred to your next draft, then you don't need to annotate it.

2. Make an **outline** of these points and their corresponding evidence. Try to order the points logically, building them up to your larger claim. An example scaffolding might look something like:

Primary Claim  
I. Point 1  
  i. evidence  
  ii. analysis of evidence  
II. Point 2  
  i. evidence  
  ii. analysis of evidence  
III. Point 3  
  i. evidence  
  ii. analysis of evidence

This is a very basic outline and your structure might look very different. But the key here is to keep your scaffolding down to the basics; you shouldn't be simply transferring your draft into outline form. You don't need to write full sentences, in fact you should try to extract your main points as succinctly as possible. This will allow you to compare points side-by-side and think about their relation to each other. Feel free to bring in any new points, evidence, or analyses that you didn't have in your exploratory draft.

3. Pick **two points** and develop them into **two separate formal paragraphs**. Try to begin each paragraph with a **topic sentence** (state what you will prove in this paragraph and how this connects to your larger claim). Then move into your **evidence**, quoting or paraphrasing from the text. Finally **analyze** your evidence and **connect** your takeaway to your larger claim.
