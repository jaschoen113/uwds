##Introduce P1 (15 minutes)
Things to emphasize:
- Main goal: create your own argument about the ideas and formal choices of either Grandin or Singer
- Three subgoals:
1) present the text accurately and fairly to an audience that may be unfamiliar with it
2) Identify something specific about the text’s ideas, evidence, and form that are worth examining more closely; this is an **interpretive problem**, a term we will be going over later today.  
3) Make a claim of your own about why your reading of this text that has some stakes attached.
- First step: acquaint yourself with the text’s particulars, and begin to test preliminary hunches, claims, definitions, and questions. To do this, sort out your initial observations about the text from claims you can make about the essay’s content, form, and rhetorical or methodological strategies.  This means writing claims based on incomplete information (since you won't have gathered all your evidence/worked out all the logical steps); know that you might need to utterly revise or correct that reading later. But starting with a hunch will get the ball rolling.
- To generate ideas: 1) Choose key parts of a text to work with that are both representative **and** notable and highlight an interpretive problem.
2) Distinguish between observations and claims (an observation is an indisputable fact, a claim is an interpretation of that fact)

##General Discussion about Grandin (15 minutes)
- take 2 or 3 minutes to read over your summary of the Grandin and any marginal notes. What are the main takeaways of her piece? What is her core argument? Was there anything you didn't understand? Were there any arguments you found more or less convincing? What did you think of her style of writing?

##Close Readings of Grandin (20 minutes)
- Remember that last class we discussed **observations** and **claims**. We looked for tensions/ambiguities/contradictions in "The Maldive Shark" and then moved towards a claim [insert more specific example after class 1 actually happens]. (4 minutes)
- For homework, I asked you guys to do something similar with Grandin. Break up into pairs and discuss the observations/claims you came up with. If you struggled to move towards a claim, then you might brainstorm with your partner how your observation moved towards a claim. As they talk, make chart with observations/claims heading (7 minutes)
- Does anyone want to share what you discussed in pairs? Maybe your partner came up with a good observation/claim you think is worth sharing? As they respond, fill in the chart. After collecting about 5 or 6, go over them with the class. Do we agree that all of these examples fit the observation/claim mold? If something isn't a claim per se, how might we turn it into one? (9 minutes)

##Working with Grandin (20 minutes)
- Now I want to present an intermediary step between an observation and a claim that I will think will help us develop more interesting claims.
- Pass out "9 ways to generate an interpretive problem"
- So I want to introduce something called an **interpretive problem**. This is going to be a key term for us all semester. An interpretive problem is basically an **observation** -- so a contradiction, tension, or ambiguity -- phrased as a question. Now I know rephrasing an observation as a question might seem a bit silly or even redundant at first, but I actually think this move can really help us to push our ideas further. Instead of simply observing a contradiction, tension, or ambiguity, now we ask -- what is the significance of that contradiction, tension, or ambiguity.
- Here we have 9 patterns that tend to generate rich interpretive problems. Here you see how we're making a distinction between **observation** and **problem**. This is a subtle difference but important for our thinking process. When we transform our observation into a problem, we now have a question to resolve. This allows us to move towards a **claim**, like we've been talking about.
- Have them read through the 9 interpretive problems. Then ask them to look back at the close reading chart we came up with initially (on the board). Do we see any of these interpretive problem patterns on the board? Is there a way we can restructure them -- add interpretive problem? Now that we have the interpretive problems, can we make any stronger claims based on those observations?
- If there isn't much development to be made from the previous chart, then have them go back to the text and look for another observation - problem - claim.
