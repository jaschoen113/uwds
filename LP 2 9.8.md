#Class Two Lesson Plan, Thursday 9/8

##To Print
- P1 prompt
- what is a problem handout
- 9 ways to generate an interpretive problem handout

##Class Goals
- Introduce P1
- Work through close readings of Grandin building off last class
- Learn how to generate interpretive problems
- Generate interpretive problems with Grandin

##Schedule
- Another icebreaker (5 minutes)
- Introduce P1 (15 minutes)
- Go over close reading strategies and their assigned exercises (20 minutes)
- Introduce "interpretive problems"/work through handout (15 minutes)
- Apply "interpretive problems to Grandin" (20 minutes)
- [If time] apply "interpretive problems" to a different kind of media - (show video of something to do with animals, maybe a clip from an animated movie or something artsier) (7 minutes)

##Another icebreaker (5 minutes)
- Play 20 questions (??) - have everyone say their name before they ask a question (5 minutes)

##Introduce P1 (15 minutes)
Things to emphasize:
- Main goal: create your own argument about the ideas and formal choices of either Grandin or Singer
- Three subgoals:
1) present the text accurately and fairly to an audience that may be unfamiliar with it
2) Identify something specific about the text’s ideas, evidence, and form that are worth examining more closely
3) Make a claim of your own about why your reading of this text that has some stakes attached.
- First step: acquaint yourself with the text’s particulars, and begin to test preliminary hunches, claims, definitions, and questions. To do this, sort out your initial observations about the text from claims you can make about the essay’s content, form, and rhetorical or methodological strategies.  This means writing claims based on incomplete information (since you won't have gathered all your evidence/worked out all the logical steps); know that you might need to utterly revise or correct that reading later. But starting with a hunch will get the ball rolling.
- To generate ideas: 1) Choose key parts of a text to work with that are both representative **and** notable.
2) Distinguish between observations and claims (other words for claim -interpretation/inference)

##Close Readings of Grandin (20 minutes)
- Remember that last class we discussed **observations** and **claims**. We looked for tensions/ambiguities/contradictions in (?? text) and then moved towards a claim [insert more specific example after class 1 actually happens]. (4 minutes)
- For homework, I asked you guys to do something similar with Grandin. Break up into pairs and discuss the observations/claims you came up with. If you struggled to move towards a claim, then you might brainstorm with your partner how your observation moved towards a claim. As they talk, make chart with observations/claims heading (7 minutes)
- Does anyone want to share what you discussed in pairs? Maybe your partner came up with a good observation/claim you think is worth sharing? As they respond, fill in the chart. After collecting about 5 or 6, go over them with the class. Do we agree that all of these examples fit the observation/claim mold? If something isn't a claim per se, how might we turn it into one? (9 minutes)

##Introduce Interpretive Problems (15 minutes)
- Pass out the "What is a problem?" worksheet. Do only page 2-4; read 2 out loud with them (not so different from tensions/ambiguities/contradictions - just an expansion of those categories). Ask them to read the examples on pages 3 and 4 and jot down which paragraphs have more sophisticated problems and why. Discuss briefly.

##Working with Grandin (20 minutes)
- Pass out "9 ways to generate an interpretive problem"
- Here is another way to think about interpretive problems. Here we have 9 patterns that tend to generate rich interpretive problems. Here you see how we're making a distinction between **observation** and **problem**. This is a subtle difference but important for our thinking process. When we transform our observation into a problem, we now have a question to resolve. This allows us to move towards a **claim**, like we've been talking about.
- Have them read through the 9 interpretive problems. Then ask them to look back at the close reading chart we came up with initially (on the board). Do we see any of these interpretive problems on the board? Is there a way we can restructure them -- add interpretive problem? Now that we have the interpretive problems, can we make any stronger claims based on those observations?
- If there isn't much development to be made from the previous chart, then have them go back to the text and look for another observation - problem - claim.

##If there is still time:
- Let's apply this formula to another media form so that we can get a sense of how this basic investigative process - observation/problem/claim - can be applied to enrich our understanding of and better articulate our ideas about any kind of source. Watch this video and try to identify one of the 9 interpretive problems. (Discuss claim as a class) [creature comforts zoo on youtube??]
