##Transition from exploratory draft to formal draft (15 minutes)
- Hand out formal draft prompt and read through it with them
- Hand out exercise three and go over outline assignment and 2 formal paragraphs
- Remember that an outline should be brief/doesn't need to be complete sentences; might want to start just jotting down potential points and then shift them around; if you could imagine proving your claim in a couple different ways, you can sketch up the possibilities and see what would be stronger
- When writing formal paragraphs, you should remember that each paragraph should serve as a semi-autonomous unit but also clearly indicate its place within the larger essay. Each paragraph should have a mini thesis. In high school you were probably asked to write a topic sentence in the beginning of each paragraph that asserts the paragraph's purpose and relation to the rest of the essay. You don't need to have such a strict structure now - often academic articles do not have explicit "topic sentences" for every paragraph. However, it is still useful to write a topic sentence for each paragraph, identifying the paragraph's argument and relation to the rest of the paper, even if you do not end up putting that sentence in a formal draft.  

##Reverse engineer TMR essay (25 minutes)
- We're gonna "reverse engineer" the essay: identify the key terms we've been discussing - observation, problem, claim, motive, warrant - and then come up with a potential outline of the essay
- Read through the essay once again; as you're reading, try to identify (underline/label) these key terms; then on a separate piece of paper come up with an outline for the whole essay
- Ask for several students to volunteer their identified terms and outlines [each student can put up one paragraph's equivalent bullet point] on the board
- Discuss the differences in outlines, if anyone missed anything etc
- Discuss, more generally, what the strengths and weaknesses of the paper are

##Exchange exploratory drafts (35 minutes)
- With the remaining time, I'd like you guys to exchange your exploratory drafts; go through your partner's draft and try to identify the main problem/claim you see emerging; remember that these are exploratory drafts so we're not looking to edit grammar or style or structure; we just want to look at the ideas presented for now
 [write some of these questions on the board as theyre reading]
  - can you identify an interpretive problem?
  - do you see one primary claim emerging, or do you see several disparate points?
  - if disparate points, do you see a potential point that could be more connective?
  - according to the claims they are making, what kinds of evidence do you still need for them to convince you?
  - do you see any potential ideas that could be fleshed out further?
  - any logical inconsistencies?
  - any ideas that are weaker than others and don't really fit in with the larger picture?
Jot down some notes after you've finished and share with your partner [make sure they are working with different partners than last class]. If you don't have enough time to complete your reading/comments, finish them after class please.
