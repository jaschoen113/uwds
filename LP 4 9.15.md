##Goals

- Identify the strengths and weaknesses of our exploratory drafts

##Schedule
- Icebreaker (5 minutes)
- Discuss the formal draft and the transition from the exploratory (15 minutes)
- Go over sample TMR essays (25 minutes)
- Exchange exploratory drafts (30 minutes)

##Icebreaker (5 minutes)
- (find an icebreaker/video/something to energize the class??)

##Transition from exploratory draft to formal draft (15 minutes)
- Hand out formal draft prompt and read through it with them
- Hand out exercise three and go over outline assignment and 2 formal paragraphs
- Remember that an outline should be brief/doesn't need to be complete sentences; might want to start just jotting down potential points and then shift them around; if you could imagine proving your claim in a couple different ways, you can sketch up the possibilities and see what would be stronger
- When writing formal paragraphs, you should remember that each paragraph should serve as a semi-autonomous unit but also clearly indicate its place within the larger essay; think of topic sentences as mini theses for each paragraph and each paragraph as a mini essay that proves a significant point, while signaling to your other mini-essays when necessary (this doesn't mean each paragraph needs to be 10 sentences long. you can have a 2 or 3 sentence paragraph that manages to present an argument, evidence, and analysis - just succinctly)

##Reverse engineer TMR essay (25 minutes)
- We're gonna "reverse engineer" the essay: identify the key terms we've been discussing - observation, problem, claim, motive, warrant - and then come up with a potential outline of the ssay
- Read through the essay once again; as you're reading, try to identify (underline/label) these key terms; then on a separate piece of paper come up with an outline for the whole essay
- Ask for several students to volunteer their identified terms and outlines [each student can put up one paragraph's equivalent bullet point] on the board
- Discuss the differences in outlines, if anyone missed anything etc
- Discuss, more generally, what the strengths and weaknesses of the paper are

##Exchange exploratory drafts (35 minutes)
- With the remaining time, I'd like you guys to exchange your exploratory drafts [if we're really short on time, we can do this via conversation instead of reading/writing on each other's papers]; go through your partner's draft and try to identify the main claim you see emerging; remember that these are exploratory drafts so we're not looking to edit grammar or style or structure; we just want to look at the ideas presented for now; do you see one primary claim emerging, or do you see several disparate points? if disparate points, do you see a potential point that could be more connective? according to the claims they are making, what kinds of evidence do you still need for them to convince you? do you see any potential ideas that could be fleshed out further? any logical inconsistencies? any ideas that are weaker than others and don't really fit in with the larger picture? [write some of these questions on the board as theyre reading] jot down some notes after you've finished and share with your partner [make sure they are working with different partners than last class]
