##Transition from exploratory draft to formal draft (15 minutes)
- Hand out formal draft prompt and read through it with them
- Hand out exercise three and go over outline assignment and 2 formal paragraphs
- Remember that an outline should be brief/doesn't need to be complete sentences; might want to start just jotting down potential points and then shift them around; if you could imagine proving your claim in a couple different ways, you can sketch up the possibilities and see what would be stronger
- When writing formal paragraphs, you should remember that each paragraph should serve as a semi-autonomous unit but also clearly indicate its place within the larger essay. Each paragraph should have a mini thesis. In high school you were probably asked to write a topic sentence in the beginning of each paragraph that asserts the paragraph's purpose and relation to the rest of the essay. You don't need to have such a strict structure now - often academic articles do not have explicit "topic sentences" for every paragraph. However, it is still useful to write a topic sentence for each paragraph, identifying the paragraph's argument and relation to the rest of the paper, even if you do not end up putting that sentence in a formal draft.  

##Reverse engineer TMR essay (25 minutes)
- We're gonna "reverse engineer" the essay: identify the key terms we've been discussing - observation, problem, claim, motive, warrant - and then come up with a potential outline of the essay
- Read through the essay once again; as you're reading, try to identify (underline/label) these key terms; then on a separate piece of paper come up with an outline for the whole essay
- Ask for several students to volunteer their identified terms and outlines [each student can put up one paragraph's equivalent bullet point] on the board
- Discuss the differences in outlines, if anyone missed anything etc
- Discuss, more generally, what the strengths and weaknesses of the paper are

##Lesson on Peer Review (15 min)
- Freewrite: think about a good and a bad experience getting your work reviewed. what made experience good or bad? discuss and list answers on the board
- Discussion, as a writer, what do you need from your reviewers? Discuss and list on board
- Now that we've started to think about this, I want to present to you a strategy for peer reviews, which we will use throughout this course. This is called **dramatizing the presence of a reader**. What does this mean? Whenever you are reading a draft, 1) narrate your experience as a reader. This is more difficult than simply marking an idea as good or bad. Try to explain to the writer your reading experience.

Example of evaluator comment:

"This is a weak argument"

Example of editorial comment:

"This is an awkward sentence"

Example of readerly comment:

"As I read this paragraph, I understand that your trying to argue x. However, I'm having trouble understanding how y connects x."

"As I read this paragraph, I can tell that you are developing x idea. I don't see yet why x is important for me to understand."

So perhaps your first impulse as a commentator is to simply write, "this argument is weak." But by narrating your readerly experience - that is, articulating what is exactly you _do_ understand about the writer's argument - and then considering why you as a reader you need that argument expanded, justified, etc., you allow the writer to understand your experience as a reader and understand how his argument might not be as complicated as he thought. We should try to make our comments as objective as possible, not only because this avoids hurt feelings etc, but because in being objective commentators we force ourselves to be specific and more helpful commentators. Reading, of course, is never entirely objective; you're still a subjective reader on some level. But by attempting to communicate your personal reading experience as clearly as possible, you allow the writer to understand a reader's experience of his work and ultimately better improve his own writing.

2) Focus on areas that the writer wants feedback on. 4) Make response appropriate to stage of writing process. For exploratory draft, we're just looking to help the writer discover the potential of initial ideas that are on the page. Don't focus on sentence-level editing.





##Exchange exploratory drafts (15 minutes)
- With the remaining time, I'd like you guys to exchange your exploratory drafts; go through your partner's draft and try to identify the main problem/claim you see emerging; remember that these are exploratory drafts so we're not looking to edit grammar or style or structure; we just want to look at the ideas presented for now
[write some of these questions on the board as theyre reading]
  - can you identify an interpretive problem?
  - do you see one primary claim emerging, or do you see several disparate points?
  - if disparate points, do you see a potential point that could be more connective?
  - according to the claims they are making, what kinds of evidence do you still need for them to convince you?
  - do you see any potential ideas that could be fleshed out further?
  - any logical inconsistencies?
  - any ideas that are weaker than others and don't really fit in with the larger picture?
Jot down some notes after you've finished and share with your partner [make sure they are working with different partners than last class]. If you don't have enough time to complete your reading/comments, finish them after class please.
