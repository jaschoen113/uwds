#P1 Exercise 4

Due Thursday 9/22  
Bring a hardcopy to class (along with your entire formal draft)

1. Read Williams and Bizup's "Clarity."

2. Pick what you believe is the best-written paragraph in your formal draft. 

2. Revise this paragraph with Williams and Bizup's article "Clarity" in mind. Remember to:

  1. Express actions and conditions in specific verbs, adverbs, or adjectives.
  2. Whenever you can, make the subjects of your verbs characters involved in those actions.

3. Re-read your paragraph. Do you think your claims are still as strong as they can be? Does this paragraph achieve as much argumentative weight as it can? Or do you still have stronger points you can make? If so, does that in any impact your larger argument/essay?
