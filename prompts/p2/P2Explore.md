## P2 Exploratory Draft

Due Wednesday 6/28

800-1000 words

As with the P1 exploratory draft, this draft is designed to help you discover ideas through the act of writing. Focus on getting as much as possible down on paper. Use this draft to experiment with new ideas. Start a new paragraph whenever you change your focus. Stop only when you feel that you have reached a satisfying, surprising conclusion.

These are the basic objectives of this draft:

1. Chose one of the **exhibits** you listed in your proposal (or a new one entirely). Describe that exhibit adequately, presupposing a reader that may or may not be familiar with it.

2. Identify an intellectual **conversation** between two assigned essays. Your interpretation of your exhibit should complicate or add to that conversation in some way, and vice versa.

3. Flesh out a **reading** of your exhibit via the same close reading strategies we practiced in P1.

4. Bolster your reading via the **two essays** you've selected.

5. Explore the **implications** of your exhibit and new potential **connections** between the essays and your exhibit.

6. Work towards a larger **claim** about your exhibit and the academic conversation.
