## P2 Checklist

**Conversation**

- Has the writer identified a dynamic academic conversation at play in both selected essays?
- Is the conversation neither too broad nor too narrow? Does it have space for the writer to add his/her own ideas?
- Does the writer show how the essays engage with the conversation?
- Does the writer show where the essays agree, disagree, or intersect in other ways?

**Exhibit**

- Is the exhibit manageable (neither too expansive nor too restrictive)?
- Is the exhibit relevant to the conversation?
- Is the exhibit ambivalent? Can it be interpreted in many ways?
- Does the writer sufficiently but not excessively describe the exhibit?

**Claim**

- Does the writer have a single overarching claim (thesis)?
- Is the claim analytical rather than evaluative? That is, does the claim say something new about the exhibit and essays rather than proving or disproving the essays via the exhibit?
- Does the claim connect the exhibit to the specified conversation?
- Is the claim original? Does the writer say something new about *both* the exhibit and essays?
- By the end of the paper, has the claim been reiterated enough for you to fully understand it?
- Does the writer address necessary counter-arguments?

**Structure**

- Does the current progression of the essay make sense to you?
- Does the writer state his/her main claim (thesis) in the beginning of the essay? If so, do the body paragraphs clearly signal that they are building towards that claim?
- Does the writer instead state his/her main claim (thesis) at the end of essay? If so, do the body paragraphs guide the reader logically to that claim?
- Does each paragraph have a specific purpose? Is that purpose signaled early on in the paragraph?
- Are paragraphs organized analytically rather than categorically? That is, are they organized around claims?
- Are transitions between paragraphs clear?
- Are transitions between sentences clear?

**Evidence**

- Does the writer provide ample evidence (both from the exhibit and the essays) to prove him/her claim?
- Does the writer close read the exhibit?
- Do these close readings complicate and develop the claims? Are there several compelling close readings?
- Does the writer draw out the nuances of both the essays and the exhibit by placing them alongside each other?

**Sources**

- Does the writer incorporate sources seamlessly into his/her paper?
- Does he/she introduce, cite, and engage with each quote?
- Does he/she use each source to either provide critical background necessary to understand the eventual claim or to directly develop the claim?
- Does the writer use quotations sufficiently but not excessively?

**Motive**

- Does the writer identify a motive for his/her essay in the introduction? That is, does he/she make it clear why the reader should keep reading the essay?
- Is the motive believable?

**Implications**

- Does the writer move beyond his main claim (thesis) in the conclusion to discuss the larger implications of that claim?
- Are those implications believable? Are they interesting, exciting, or surprising? Do they leave you with a new appreciation of the writer's argument?

**Citations**

- Does the writer use properly formatted in-text citations?
- Does the writer include a properly formatted works cited page?
