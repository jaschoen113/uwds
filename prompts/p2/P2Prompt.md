## Progression two: Conversation Essay

Draft Deadlines:

Proposal due **Tuesday 2/20**

Exploratory draft due **Tuesday 2/27**

Formal draft due **Tuesday 3/6**

Final draft due **Monday 3/19**

Prompt:

Find an **exhibit** that you can interpret alongside **two** of our course readings (Ford, Turing, Jamison, Martin, Hofstadter, Slater, Dennett, Grandin).

An exhibit can be a text, a film, an event, a performance, a speech, an image, or anything that can be interpreted and carries the potential for rich analysis. In P1, the essay that you close read was your exhibit. In P2, you select your own exhibit, and use the assigned essays to bolster your close reading of your chosen exhibit. In addition, you will be entering into a specific academic **conversation** via your exhibit and chosen essays. Your goal is to show how your exhibit can complicate that existing academic conversation, as well as how the conversation can complicate our understanding of your exhibit.

Keep in mind that an exhibit is not merely an example. While an example merely affirms an argument, an exhibit is dynamic; indeed, the exhibit itself may raise problems with our status quo understanding. Through careful analysis, our developing ideas about the exhibit may change or challenge our initial assumptions.

Progression Goals:

- Identify and enter into an intellectual **conversation** via two essays

- Select an **exhibit** that lends itself to dynamic interpretation and intersects with your chosen conversation

- Develop a strong **claim** about your exhibit that is original and debatable

- Maintain a coherent **structure**

- Use **evidence** fairly and persuasively

- Integrate your **sources** with deliberation and purpose, using the **ICE method:** introduce, cite, explain

- Establish a strong **motive** in your introduction

- Draw out **implications** in your conclusion

- Document sources using properly formatted **MLA in-text citations** and a **works cited** page

Length:

The paper should be __1500-2000__ words long (include a word count at the end of each draft).

Note: If one of your selected essays is the essay you used for P1, you may not write about the same topic. In other words, you cannot simply adapt your P1 paper into your P2 paper. If you want to use the same essay for P2, you **must** meet with me to discuss how you will use it differently.
