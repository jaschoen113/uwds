## P2 Formal Draft

Due Tuesday 3/6 

1100-1400 words

As you shape your exploratory draft into a formal draft, follow these basic guidelines:

Beginning:

1. Write a *working* **title** and a **introduction** for your essay’s formal draft (no more than a page). Keep in mind that your introduction will evolve as your writing evolves.

2. Present your **exhibit**, giving enough context that an intelligent reader who is unfamiliar with this exhibit would understand the project you wish to pursue in this essay.

3. Identify the academic **conversation** that you're entering.

4. This is also a good place to raise the interpretive questions that guide your inquiry, and to propose some **initial claims** you will explore in the body of the essay.

5. Present a **motive** to keep your readers engaged.

Middle:

3. Build off your exploratory draft, developing formal paragraphs out of the most productive ideas in that draft. **Structure** these paragraphs around claims and analysis; don't just pile up evidence in separate heaps.

5. Your analysis should be **grounded in details** about the exhibit itself. When you ask yourself guiding questions (e.g. “What do these critical sources illuminate about my exhibit? What does my exhibit illuminate about my critical sources?”), your answers should draw on specific aspects of the exhibit and specific quotes from the texts we’ve read.

6. The exhibit that you choose is crucial to this assignment; the exhibit should lie at the crux of your two critical sources, **mediating** the texts and helping you to draw out their nuances. The sources, in return, should bolster and **complicate** your reading of the exhibit.

4. Remember that the **structure** of your essay will have an internal logic. At the medium scale, a reader should be able to see a claim develop over the space of a paragraph. At the large scale, a reader should be able to see your linked claims building the project of your essay.

End:

4. Flesh out the **implications** of your argument.
