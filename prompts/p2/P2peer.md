## P2 Exploratory Draft Peer Review
Due Friday 3/10

As with P1 peer review, aim for at least one marginal note per page, along with an end-comment. Look towards the P2 Prompt and Checklist for feedback inspiration. Focus on big picture items (structure, argument, etc) before stylistic issues. Remember to be generous in your criticism. Non-useful comments are ones like "I don't think any of these ideas will work" or "You don't have an argument yet." Useful comments are ones like "I think this idea is potentially more fruitful than this other idea" or "You're moving towards an argument here, but haven't quite gotten there yet. You might think about..."
