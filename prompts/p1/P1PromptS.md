##Progression one: Critical Response Essay

Draft Deadlines:

Exploratory draft due **Friday 6/2**

Formal draft due **Wednesday 6/7**  

Final draft due **Sunday 6/18**   

Prompt:  

Your first essay will focus on one of the two texts that we’ve read in this progression (Ford or Jamison). It helps to work on a text that you feel drawn to or engaged by. Being ‘drawn to’ a text is different from liking or disliking it. Being 'drawn to' a text means feeling that you could help someone read your text more deeply, see it in a new light, or understand something about the text that he or she might have missed.

Your essay should be crafted around a close reading of the text. When you close read a text, you do not simply summarize what the text says, nor do you simply seek to prove or disprove the author's argument. Rather, you describe what the text is *doing* and why the writer might have made the writerly choices he/she did. You can close read a single passage or a pattern that you find throughout the text. More important is that you select one *specific* passage or pattern with rich language and/or form that might be interpreted in more than one way. Your original interpretation of that passage or pattern will then develop into an original argument about the essay at large.

Essay projects of this kind generally accomplish one or more of the following aims:

   - extend readers’ understanding of a text (“the text is about X, but it’s also about Y”)

   - illuminate a lacuna (“we have a gap in our knowledge and this is how to fill it”)

   - correct a possible misreading (“we may think it’s X, but actually it is Y”)

   - demonstrate the relationship of parts to the whole (“we can’t understand X until we can see Y”)

Progression Goals:

- Identify a __single passage or pattern__ in a one essay that will reward close reading.

- Develop your __close reading__ by looking specifically at the language and form of the essay in question.  

- Formulate a __claim__ that makes a strong argument and is not obvious.

- __Structure__ the essay around your central claim, making sure that each paragraph is adding an essential piece to your argument.

- Use __evidence__ persuasively, quoting from the text when necessary, summarizing or paraphrasing accurately and responsibly when appropriate. Do not provide evidence from other sources or make general assertions (e.g., claims about “human nature”).

- Establish a __motive__ in your introduction which explains why your essay is important and interesting to an intelligent reader.

- Draw out the __implications__ of your argument in your conclusion.

Length:
The paper should be __1200-1500__ words long (include a word count at the end of each draft).
