The purpose of this draft is to explore your ideas through the act of writing. This is an **informal** document. You should focus on content rather than form. Try not to stop writing even if you're not quite sure where a point may be going. Explore each potential idea and see if the very act of writing can get you to a larger claim. Don't worry too much about structure, but begin a new paragraph/section every time you do something new.

These are the general objectives for this draft:

1.  Select whether you'd like to write on  **Jamison**, **Turing** or **Ford** (you can only write on one text for this progression).

2.  Select a passage or pattern of passages that has rich language and/or form that you can interpret originally. Type the passage(s) in a document and cite the page number(s).

3. **Reread the passage(s)** you've chosen, then **reread the entire essay**, making note of any details that are particularly relevant to your selected passage(s).

4. Analyze the passage(s) you've chosen. Look **closely at the text**, trying to extract as much as you can from the language and structure of the writing. Don't worry about writing a proper introduction just yet -- just focus on close reading.

5. Work your close readings into larger **claims** about the text as a whole. Think about how your textual observations connect to the author's larger project. By the end of the draft, reach a major claim that might serve as your thesis.

If you are still struggling to select a passage(s), here are some tips:

- A passage may be a single sentence or several sentences long. A pattern may be a term/expression/image/device/question, etc. that occurs in different places throughout the essay.

- Select a passage(s) that requires interpretation, has terms that shift in meaning, and/or has claims that suggest significant room for debate. Don't select a passage that simply declares a basic point or sums up the author's ideas.   

- Select a passage(s) that will allow you to analyze the text in an original way. Don't select a passage that is simply a weak spot in the author's argument. Remember the goal of this essay is to create our own interesting claims, not to knock down the claims of others.

If you are still struggling to interpret your passage(s), here are some questions you might ask yourself:

- What is the author saying in this passage? What is the author *doing* in this passage? How do they relate?
- Why might the author choose these specific terms to convey his/her point?
- Why might the author choose these specific images to convey his/her point?
- Why might the author structure his/her argument this way?
- What makes this passage stand out from the rest of the text?
- Are there any assumptions that the author makes, either explicitly or implicitly? How does recognizing those assumptions change how we understand his or her argument?
- Why does the author choose this particular evidence or particular kind of evidence?
- Do any passages from the rest of the text support your interpretation of this particular passage?
