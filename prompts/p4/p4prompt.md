## P4 Prompt

Proposal due **Thursday 12/7**

Final draft due **Tuesday 12/12**

Write an op-ed article that you could submit to a publication of your choice. You may revise one of the papers you’ve written for this class, or you may choose an entirely new argument. Ideally the op-ed would somehow relate to science and technology in some way, but it's also okay to branch out; just let me know ahead of time.

Like the previous essays you’ve already written, this assignment requires you to find a question or problem worthy of further analysis, select and close read an exhibit, and make an original claim. However, this assignment is formally and stylistically quite different from the previous ones.

Yours is now a public conversation. This means you should distill your most important ideas into clear, concise prose that will appeal to the specific audience you have identified. From start to finish, imagine the people you’re talking to. Write like your perfectly-articulate, talking self. Consider if your audience might already know the basics of your topic, and therefore what specific context your particular audience will really need to understand your opinion. It’s not that op-eds need NO context, it’s that they require a more targeted kind.

Along with your final draft, you must also submit a paragraph explaining which publication you have in mind for this draft, along with a rationale for that publication (~100 words).

You can get extra credit on this draft! If you submit this op-ed to the publication, you'll get one extra point on the final essay grade. If your op-ed gets published by that publication, you'll get two extra points (for a total of 3 extra points). The only exceptions to this second bonus are Columbia newspapers.

Progression Goals:

1. Choose a reputable **publication** that might be interested in your opinion and adhere to the style of that publication

2. Direct your essay around the **audience** of your chosen publication

3. Develop a **voice** that is clear and engaging, in a tone and style dependent on your audience and persuasive tactic

4. State your **opinion** clearly, and do so as quickly as possible

5. Choose an **exhibit** that helps you illustrate your opinion (your exhibit should probably be news)

6. Use additional **evidence** when necessary, but do not get bogged down by research (this is an opinion piece, not a research paper)

7. **Structure** your essay so that it moves quickly (i.e. avoid large paragraphs)

8. Articulate a **motive.** Op-ed motives are often more obvious than intellectual pieces (for example, calls to action)

Length:

~750 words
