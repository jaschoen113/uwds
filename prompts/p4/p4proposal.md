## P4 Proposal    

Due Thursday 12/7 

500 words

Write a proposal in which you address each of these sections (label them within your draft).

1. **Audience**: Who do you want to speak to? What publication do you have in mind? Briefly describe the publication - who is its audience? What kind of people read this publication? Include a link to a website, if there is one.  

2. **Style**: Keeping in mind the audience of your target publication, write at least two sentences describing the writing style you think you might want to use: funny? punchy? solemn? short, snappy sentences? If it’s an online publication you have in mind, will you include any links? Embedded media?

3. **Context**: Write at least two sentences describing the background information that you’ll have to provide to your audience.

4. **Motive**: Write at least two sentences describing the “payoff” that you have in mind. What do you want your writing to do in the world? To your readers? To the public?

5. **Exhibits**: Write at least three bits of recent news that you might like to use as an exhibit. Remember that you will use one or two of these exhibits to make your point. This exhibit might come from an essay that you’ve already read, or it might be an exhibit that you came across in research that you discarded and never wrote about, or it might be something you came across yesterday that grabbed your attention. The important point is that you have an exhibit that is topical and up-to-date. Newspapers and similar periodicals are very time-sensitive.

6. **Argument**: Now that you’ve thought about who you want to speak to, how you want to speak, and what you want to offer them as exhibits—what do you want to say? Write two sentences describing the problem that you want to engage. Then write one sentence describing the claim that you will make about that problem.
