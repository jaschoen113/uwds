## P3 Proposal
Due Tuesday 3/27

500-700 words

This proposal is meant to establish your research topic and question. In order to settle on your topic and question, you will have to do some preliminary research first. But once you have decided on a topic and question, this exercise will help you narrow your research moving forward.

Before you begin this proposal, read through "From Topics to Questions" and "From Questions to Problems" again. You are essentially expanding on your topic in section 1, question in section 2, and problem in section 3.

1. (~300-500 words) Describe your general research project/topic. Make sure to accomplish the following:
  - Describe the exhibit you have chosen
  - Describe what specifically you are examining about the exhibit
  - Describe the larger conversation you are entering via your exhibit (historical/cultural conversation or genre conversation - and which specific one). You might include some preliminary research here, or at least a summary of background research. That is, include the more "encyclopedic" research that sets the context for your specific research question.
  - Describe how your exhibit intersects with that conversation  

2. (~100 words) Pose three to five investigative questions. These are your guiding research questions. Remember that some questions are too general (e.g. “How does virtual reality impact the viewer?”) and others have obvious answers (e.g. “Is virtual reality a different viewer experience than a normal film?”). We want to avoid those. Try to stray away from questions that begin with "Is/Does/Can/Should…" and instead gravitate "What/How/Why/To what extent/…"" Remember that strong investigative questions are specific and narrow.

4. (~100 words) Articulate the motive and stakes of your research project: What will your readers realize about the conversation/exhibit if you answer your questions? What will we fail too see if you don’t answer these questions?
