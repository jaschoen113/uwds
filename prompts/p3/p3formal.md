## P3 Formal Draft

Due 7/31

2000-2500 words

As you shape your exploratory draft into a formal draft, follow these basic guidelines:

Beginning:

1. Write a working **title** for your essay

2. Try to write a catchy **introduction** (you might do this step last). "Catchy" doesn't necessarily mean cute or campy; it just means it grabs the attention of the reader *somehow*

2. Lay out your **research topic** and **research question** in the introduction

3. Also signal **how you will answer** that research question in this paper

4. Establish a **motive** to keep the reader engaged

Middle:

1. Close read your **exhibit** somewhere in the body

2. Integrate **sources** appropriately; introduce them where necessary, describe them at length if you need to, or just drop them in briefly, if that’s what you need to do

3. Shape your **paragraphs** by analytical categories, and align your paragraphs logically, transitioning clearly between both sentences and paragraphs

4. Build those paragraphs into your larger **claim**. Even if you hold off on your final claim until the end of the paper, the reader should still feel grounded and guided at all times by your logical progression between sub-claims

3. Maintain your own **voice** among all of this noise

End:

1. Indicate what the **implications** of your research are (why this topic matters—both to you and to others)

2. Write a **conclusion** that leaves a lasting impression on the reader
