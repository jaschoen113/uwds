##Lesson 1

- select a poem for a close reading (or maybe do a passage from grandin?) and make a handout with it

##Lesson 2

- select an icebreaker (ideally on theme?)
- decide whether to set aside 15-20 min to simply discuss grandin (at the moment jumping into close readings and then interpretive problems, using grandin, but no overview of grandin)
- incorporate "interpretive problem" in lesson more
- what do about holding off on "interpretive problem" until lesson 2 -- will this confuse them?
- have them generate a reading prompt for singer?

##Lesson 3

- select another icebreaker/maybe a video (establish its relation to class)
- reading prompt for tmr essay?
- make/combine handout with warrant and motive; potentially then have a handout with all these terms laid out?  

##Lesson 4

- select another icebreaker/maybe a video
- take out language about topic sentences?
- have them read full drafts and email commments if they run out of time

##Lesson 5
- establish better goals
- find clip connected to empathy/animals/linguistics/editing

##Lesson 6
- think about switching lesson 5 and 6 - macro vs micro revision?
- somewhere (maybe even in lesson 4, and again here,) go over constructive criticism/peer feedback; phrase this better also
- bring in disucssion of when to identify claims/style

##Explor Draft
- rephrase questions

##ex 2
- pick one of them?

##p1 formal draft
- make sure language is synced up with lessons

##ex 4
- describe "strong point" better

##ex 3
- make sure interpretive problem is in there
- take out topic sentences? rephrase it?

##syllabus
- change grade weights
- either take out or leave in exercises for p2 and p3
- add date/time for op-ed workshop

##courseworks
- make sure all p1 materials are on courseworks - readings, handouts, excercises, prompts; add links between github site and courseworks?

##questions
- any better ways to describe positive/neutral peer review?
- can i do radical revision class before they've hand in formal draft?
- tips for better incorporating theme? obviously working with texts will help this, but i am worried that its hard to balance
- when is the op-ed workshop?
- grade weights - is there any flexibility beyond the two options? simon said 40% is high for p3, but thats the only option unless you do the 5% floating
- suggestions about distinguishing between close reading and interpretive problems/would it help to start with interpretive problems on day one?

##after exploratory draft

- give them little red schoolhouse handout, maybe after exploratory 
- complex arguments - research and writing process (Experienced arguments come up with complex arguments); work with drafts and transitional moments to assess whether complex or simple (the language which signals a shift in the arugment) 
- peer review: teach in p1 and p2; only responsbility to be a reader (then revise the comments) 
- assign peer review as an assignment 
- - rasidcal revision - keeps writing provisional, help develop more complex ideas
