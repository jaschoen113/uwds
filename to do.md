**for now**

##courseworks/site
- do practice run of lesson
- print 16 copies of syllabus, maldive shark handout, ex 1, and 1 copy of sign up sheet and lesson plan


**for later**

##Lesson 3

- make/combine handout with warrant and motive; potentially then have a handout with all these terms laid out?  

##Lesson 5

- add complex structure to lesson in addition to complex argument? or keep 35 minutes for radical revision in class? (that feels like too much)
- make a complex argument [maybe complex structure] handout?

##Lesson 6

- make handout/slideshow/etc with the reader/writer examples and the bad sentences examples


##other ideas
- work with drafts and transitional moments to assess whether complex or simple (the language which signals a shift in the arugment)
