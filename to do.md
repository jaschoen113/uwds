##Lesson 1

- make handout of maldive shark
- keep patricia klein close reading OR have a selection of just three good close readings? due for day 2

##Lesson 3

- make/combine handout with warrant and motive; potentially then have a handout with all these terms laid out?  

##Lesson 5

- add complex structure to lesson in addition to complex argument? or keep 35 minutes for radical revision in class? (that feels like too much)
- make a complex argument [maybe complex structure] handout?

##Lesson 6

- make handout/slideshow/etc with the reader/writer examples and the bad sentences examples


##syllabus
- change grade weights
- either take out or leave in exercises for p2 and p3
- add date/time for op-ed workshop
- decide whether to do exhibit or not in p2
- change word limits

##courseworks/site
- make sure all p1 materials are on courseworks - readings, handouts, excercises, prompts; add links between github site and courseworks?

##questions
- when is the op-ed workshop?
- grade weights - is there any flexibility beyond the two options? simon said 40% is high for p3, but thats the only option unless you do the 5% floating

##after exploratory draft
- work with drafts and transitional moments to assess whether complex or simple (the language which signals a shift in the arugment)

- tell meadhbh to upload whichever texts i pick
