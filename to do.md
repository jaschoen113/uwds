##Lesson 1

- select a poem for a close reading (or maybe do a passage from grandin?) and make a handout with it 

##Lesson 2

- select an icebreaker (ideally on theme?)
- decide whether to set aside 15-20 min to simply discuss grandin (at the moment jumping into close readings and then interpretive problems, using grandin, but no overview of grandin) 
- incorporate "interpretive problem" in lesson more 
- what do about holding off on "interpretive problem" until lesson 2 -- will this confuse them? 
- have them generate a reading prompt for singer? 

##Lesson 3

- select another icebreaker/maybe a video (establish its relation to class) 
- reading prompt for tmr essay?
- make/combine handout with warrant and motive; potentially then have a handout with all these terms laid out?  

##Lesson 4

- select another icebreaker/maybe a video 
- take out language about topic sentences? 
- have them read full drafts and email commments if they run out of time 

##Lesson 5
- establish better goals 
- find clip connected to empathy/animals/linguistics/editing 

##Lesson 6
- think about switching lesson 5 and 6 - macro vs micro revision? 
- somewhere (maybe even in lesson 4, and again here,) go over constructive criticism/peer feedback; phrase this better also 
- bring in disucssion of when to identify claims/style
