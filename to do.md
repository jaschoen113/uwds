##Lesson 3

- make/combine handout with warrant and motive; potentially then have a handout with all these terms laid out?  

##Lesson 5

- add complex structure to lesson in addition to complex argument? or keep 35 minutes for radical revision in class? (that feels like too much)
- make a complex argument [maybe complex structure] handout?

##Lesson 6

- make handout/slideshow/etc with the reader/writer examples and the bad sentences examples


##syllabus

##courseworks/site
- make sure all p1 materials are on google site - readings, handouts, excercises, prompts; add links between github site and courseworks?

##other admin

- tell meadhbh to upload whichever texts i pick
- send syllabus and videos to offic

- do practice run of lesson

##other ideas
- work with drafts and transitional moments to assess whether complex or simple (the language which signals a shift in the arugment)
