General Research Intro (20 mins)

I want to go to a restaurant with two friends this weekend. One of my friends is vegetarian. We want to go the east-side of Manhattan. I have to take the subway but I have a phobia of the NQR. One of my friends needs to be within 5 minutes walking distance of a national landmark at all times. One of my friends can't stand restaurants that play loud music. We all need to be within 7 minutes distance walking distance of a subway stop. Please find us a place to go.

Free-write: Where did you start? How did you know where to go? How did you filter the information? How did you know which sources to trust and which ones not to? Did you find the answer to your question? If not, what else do you think you'd need to do? How do you do research everyday? What are our strategies? What tools do we use? How do we discern between reliable and unreliable sources?

- You already have certain criteria going into the search, so that you find a solution (an answer/claim)
- Could you convince me more if you had a new yorker review to go with it? what holds more weight? sources as weighted
- How could you come up with a more confident answer? What could have been more helpful to know from the start?

Free-write: what is a research paper? How is a research paper different from another paper (like the ones we've written so far)? How might it be the same?

- Research paper is not just collecting research, but still synthesizing it and hoping to find an answer to a specific question you raise, via other sources that maybe haven't asked the exact same question
