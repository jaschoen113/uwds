Sagan Presentation (30 minutes)

P4 Workshop (30 minutes)

Relevance/Exhibit Exercise (15 minutes)
- Everyone open up some news sites (CNN, New York Times, BBC, NPR, Wired, wherever you go to for news). Don't look at the opinion/editorial pages, but instead browse through "news" sections (you can look at political, local, international, technology news - any section). Find something that is in the news today that you can imagine writing an op-ed on. You might also just select something you've read/heard about/thought about in the past couple days and remember. Try to select something that relates in any way to science/technology, but that can be very broad (it could be, for example, the internet and something else).
- Get some examples on the board. Brainstorm different op-eds that might evolve around those topics. Try to get several different kinds of opinions around the same topic.
