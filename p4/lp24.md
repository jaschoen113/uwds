Op-ed Prompt and checklist (10 minutes)

NYT Piece (25 minutes)

- Read outloud the NTY piece
- Make our own Op-Ed checklist (borrow from Duke)
 - follow up questions:
  - what opinions do we respect and why? what makes for a convincing opinion? (Persuasiveness, position of the author, do they know their stuff, confidence, interesting angle, good recommendation for what we should do, itâ€™s not just analysis) what did you find in your reading of the op-ed packets?
- Put on board and discuss  
- Important to keep in mind that an opinion is just that -- it's not a fact, it's disputable. An op-ed is not a well researched paper, like P3 -- it may easily stem from research, but doesn't show its research in the piece. An op-ed is not a letter to the editor - it's not a criticism of another piece. But just because it is opinion based, doesn't mean you can just throw down your opinions without making a case for them either.


TMR Op-eds
- Select a favorite, have everyone read that one again
- Discuss its structure, tone, etc
- How do they start? Where is the claim?
- What is the audience? How do they adapt to that audience?
- Have Duke up for inspiration
