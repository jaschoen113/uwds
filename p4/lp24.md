Intro (5 minutes)
- Final progression is a 750 word opinion piece. This is going to be quite unlike our other papers. I won't be reading a formal draft, but you will have a short exploratory draft due for next Tuesday (establish your topic). And you will read more Op-Eds for Thursday and do a very short assignment with one of them. 
- The prompt is up, but we'll go over it more next class. This class, I want to work towards defining an op-ed, then I want to start thining about how we might turn our P3 papers into op-eds if we wanted to. 

750 opinion piece

NYT Piece (25 minutes)

- Read outloud the NTY piece
- Make our own Op-Ed checklist (borrow from Duke)
 - follow up questions: 
  - what opinions do we respect and why? what makes for a convincing opinion? (Persuasiveness, position of the author, do they know their stuff, confidence, interesting angle, good recommendation for what we should do, it’s not just analysis) what did you find in your reading of the op-ed packets?
- Put on board and discuss  
- Important to keep in mind that an opinion is just that -- it's not a fact, it's disputable. An op-ed is not a well researched paper, like P3 -- it may easily stem from research, but doesn't show its research in the piece. An op-ed is not a letter to the editor - it's not a criticism of another piece. But just because it is opinion based, doesn't mean you can just throw down your opinions without making a case for them either. 

Rewriting/using previous work (15 minutes)
- If you were to rewrite your P3 into an op-ed piece, how might you go about it? What kinds of changes would you make? What would you be your core argument? How would it be different from your research paper? 
- Try to write a brief summary of the main points you would want to make in an op-ed version of your current P3 paper -- really free-write here (don't stop writing) 

Elevator Pitches (30 minutes) 
- Imagine you were in an elevator with an editor of a major newspaper/journal/etc and you had 1 minute to pitch your P3 op-ed version. 
- What does an editor need to know, based on our list? 
 - The topic of the piece – context
 - The point you’re going to make/ the angle/ is it original?
 - Do you have evidence/ a theory for what you’re trying to say?
 - Why does it matter?
 - Why do their readers need to know?

1 minute pitch to each other. Listener is editor: consider, were you sold? What else did you need to know? Confused?

Discuss (large group or pairs??) 5 mins.
