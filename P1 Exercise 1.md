#Exercise 1: Annotate, Summarize, and Close Read

- Word limit: 400 w.

1. **Annotate**: Print out and carefully read the essay "Animals are not things" by Temple Grandin. Annotate along the way, using at least one new annotation technique that you haven't tried before (i.e. underlining instead of highlighting (or vice versa), circling words you don't understand, bracketing key words, writing questions in the margins, underling topic sentences, summarizing in the margin, drawing arrows between ideas)

1. **Summarize**: In two to three sentences, summarize the essay by describing the author's main claims and intentions. Try to keep your summary as precise as possible (don't exceed 3 sentences).

1. **Close Read**: Carefully choose a short passage that youâ€™d like to investigate. As we have discussed in class, you should look for a __tension__, an __ambiguity__ or a __contradiction__ in the text. Underline words and phrases that are especially resonant; as you annotate, think about the __meaning__ and __purpose__ of the passage. First, write down your **observations**: What is unique about this passage? Then write down a **claim** building off those observations: What is the effect of this tension, ambiguity, or contradiction? How does it relate to or conflict with the larger point (see your summary) that Grandin is making in this essay? (~200 words)
