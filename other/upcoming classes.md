## free writing questions
1) What do you find most difficult about writing?
2) Has anyone ever told you something about your writing that you agree you need to work on?
3) What are your goals for your writing in this class and in college in general?
4) In what context do you imagine you will need to write in your life? (in the next four years or beyond). Why will improving your writing be necessary for those tasks? You might try to think of various different contexts.
