things to do in upcoming classes:

- citations (have them each write up the MLA citation for whichever texts they are using)
- go over close reading, evaluative vs analytical arguments once again; have them make sure their argument is analytical, not evaluative; have them make sure they are looking at a specific formal element of the their exhibit
-


## free writing questions
1) What do you find most difficult about writing?
2) Has anyone ever told you something about your writing that you agree you need to work on?
3) What are your goals for your writing in this class and in college in general?
4) In what context do you imagine you will need to write in your life? (in the next four years or beyond). Why will improving your writing be necessary for those tasks? You might try to think of various different contexts.

##good exhibits

netflix selection algorithm, driverless car, amazon
bed bugs and suicide
steph curry and athlete as distributed body
cathy o'neil - weapons of mass destruction
look for disruptive - something that's bothering you

##blei
- presentation, field some questions from students, set aside time to generate questions (groups, individually)
- how to craft questions - how do you come up with project idas? how do you execute it?


##other ideas
- have them when they hand in papers say what they would change
- cold calling, say early in semester that you do this because they wanna hear from you, dont take it as you have to say something if you dont have anything to say can always just pass it on ; tend to cold call on students when there is an answer they have to prepare -- not intrepretive work on their feet
- put questions and answers as focus of every class
- use coming to terms to frame project
- use general intellectual takeaways
- what is their claim and how do they justify it?
- after first reading, make sure students read out loud important part of the text in class; make sure you're generating textual problems; have them look specifically at passage -- what are the patterns you see here?
- post your annotations -- tie to interpretive problems, if you're looking for changing expectations then write out your expectation before hand
- what dennis tenen chapters would be good
