#P1 Exploratory Draft

(800-1000 words)

This draft is about finding and exploring ideas and developing the intellectual problem that you have discovered through your reading. It is impossible to know if you've chosen a fruitful line of inquiry for your essay before you try to write. This assignment is a chance to explore your project and to discover ideas through writing, without a full-on commitment. The following steps should serve as a guide to your exploration:

1) **Select** whether you'd like to write on Singer or Grandin (you can only write on one text for this progression).

2) **Select** a passage or pair of passages in which you can identify a potential problem, tension, or complication. Type the passage(s) in a document and cite the page number.

3) Reread the passage(s) you've chosen, then reread the entire essay, making note of any details that are particularly relevant to your selected passage.

4) In the same or a separate document, begin analyzing the passage you've chosen. Identify the intellectual problem you've noticed, and build up your support by looking closely at the text.  

Here are some potential questions you might answer in your draft:  

- Why do you think the author chooses these terms to convey his or her point?  
- How does the author construct a problem?  
- What claims does the author make?  
- What evidence does he or she provide?
- Why does the author make certain distinctions among ideas?
- Are there any assumptions that the author makes, either explicitly or implicitly?
- How does recognizing those assumptions change how we understand his or her argument?
- Why does the author choose this particular evidence or particular kind of evidence?  
- How do the author’s choices support his or her argument?
- How does evidence from the rest of the text support your interpretation of the author’s argument in this particular passage?

Here are a few more tips:

- Select passages that offer evidence that requires interpretation, terms that shift in meaning, and/or claims that suggest significant room for debate. Don't select passages that simply declare a basic point or sum up the author's ideas.   

- The passage(s) may be a single sentence or several sentences long.

- Remember that this is an informal document. Focus on content rather than form.

- You do not need to write a formal introduction for now. Simply start by presenting your problem.

- Don't worry too much about structure, but begin a new paragraph every time you do something new.

- Carefully expound each transition. Do not take any logical step for granted.
