Due Tuesday 9/13  

~400 words

1. First, **read** Joseph Harris' "Coming to Terms."

2. **Apply** Harris' process as you read Singer's "Speciesism:"

  - Read "Speciesism" once through, annotating along the way.
  - Put the essay away.
  - Without consulting the text, state the author’s project in your own words (1 paragraph). [Yes, this is really hard. Give it your best shot.]
  - Pull out the essay again.
  - Write “an account of the text that makes use of paraphrase and direct quotation.” (1-2 paragraphs)

3. Select one passage in the Singer where you see one of the 9 Interpretive Problems we discussed in class (see handout). Identify your **observation**, write a corresponding **interpretive problem**, and propose a possible **claim** in response to the problem. (~100 words)
