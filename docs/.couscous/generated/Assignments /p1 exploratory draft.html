<p>Due Thursday 9/15<br />
Bring hard copy to class</p>
<p>800-1000 words</p>
<p>This draft is about finding and exploring ideas and developing the intellectual problem that you have discovered through your reading. It is impossible to know if you've chosen a fruitful line of inquiry for your essay before you try to write. This assignment is a chance to explore your project and to discover ideas through writing, without a full-on commitment. The following steps should serve as a guide to your exploration:</p>
<p>1) Select whether you'd like to write on <strong>Singer</strong> or <strong>Grandin</strong> (you can only write on one text for this progression).</p>
<p>2) Select a passage in which you can identify a potential <strong>tension</strong>, <strong>contradiction</strong>, or <strong>ambiguity</strong>. Type the passage in a document and cite the page number.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Reread the passage</strong> you've chosen, then <strong>reread the entire essay</strong>, making note of any details that are particularly relevant to your selected passage.</p>
<p>4) In the same or a separate document, begin analyzing the passage you've chosen. Work through an <strong>observation, problem,</strong> and <strong>claim</strong> and <strong>build up</strong> your support by looking closely at the text. Also explore a potential <strong>motive</strong> for your reading.</p>
<p>If you are still struggling to come up with a rich interpretive problem at this point, here are some potential questions you might consider as you brainstorm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do you think the author chooses these terms to convey his or her point?</li>
<li>How does the author construct a problem?</li>
<li>What claims does the author make?</li>
<li>What evidence does he or she provide?</li>
<li>Why does the author make certain distinctions among ideas?</li>
<li>Are there any assumptions that the author makes, either explicitly or implicitly?</li>
<li>How does recognizing those assumptions change how we understand his or her argument?</li>
<li>Why does the author choose this particular evidence or particular kind of evidence?  </li>
<li>How do the author’s choices support his or her argument?</li>
<li>How does evidence from the rest of the text support your interpretation of the author’s argument in this particular passage?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few more tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a passage that requires interpretation, has terms that shift in meaning, and/or has claims that suggest significant room for debate. Don't select a passage that simply declares a basic point or sum up the author's ideas.   </li>
<li>The passage may be a single sentence or several sentences long. The &quot;passage&quot; may also be a term/expression/image/device/question, etc. that occurs in different places throughout the essay. But you shouldn't just be piling up examples; you need to raise a <em>specific</em> problem as a result of a <em>specifc</em> observation.</li>
<li>Remember that this is an informal document. Focus on content rather than form. Try not to stop writing even if you're not quite sure where a point may be going. Explore each potential idea and see if the very act of writing can get you to a larger claim.</li>
<li>You do not need to write a formal introduction for now. Simply start by presenting your problem.</li>
<li>Don't worry too much about structure, but begin a new paragraph/section every time you do something new.</li>
<li>Carefully expound each transition. Do not take any logical step for granted.</li>
</ul>
