<p>Due Friday 9/16
Via Google Docs (your peer's P1 project file)</p>
<p>In the margins, identify the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A potential interpretive problem (if the writer seems to have several interpretive problems, identify which one you think he/she currently gravitating towards)</li>
<li>A potential claim deriving from an interpretive problem (again, if there are several claims, try to identify the primary claim you see emerging)</li>
<li>Ideas that intrigue you and you are curious to see expanded</li>
<li>Ideas that you do not see connecting to the main interpretive problem/primary claim</li>
</ul>
<p>In a comment below the draft, you might comment on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does their interpretive problem stem from an incontestable observation?</li>
<li>Can you identify what type of interpretive problem it is?</li>
<li>Do you think the problem can be even further complicated? If so, what further questions would you like them to answer?</li>
<li>Does a claim follow logically from the interpretive problem?</li>
<li>Does the claim relate the specific problem to the larger text?</li>
<li>What kind of further evidence do you need to accept the writer's claim?</li>
<li>If there are strands of disparate thought, do you see a potential connection between them? Or are they working towards different problems/claims?   </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Remember these are <strong>exploratory drafts</strong> that you are reviewing. Do not focus on grammar, spelling, etc. Instead try to identify <strong>productive lines of thought</strong> that you see developing in your peer's writing that might be further expanded in a formal draft.</li>
<li>Try as best you can to <strong>dramatize the presence of a reader</strong>. Describe what you understand the writer to be communicating and how you are following or not following her ideas.  </li>
</ul>
