This draft is about finding and exploring ideas and developing the intellectual problem that you have discovered through your reading. It is impossible to know if you've chosen a fruitful line of inquiry for your essay before you try to write. This assignment is a chance to explore your project and to discover ideas through writing, without a full-on commitment. The following steps should serve as a guide to your exploration:

1) Select whether you'd like to write on **Singer** or **Grandin** (you can only write on one text for this progression).

2) Select a passage in which you can identify a potential **tension**, **contradiction**, or **ambiguity**. Type the passage in a document and cite the page number.

3) **Reread the passage** you've chosen, then **reread the entire essay**, making note of any details that are particularly relevant to your selected passage.

4) In the same or a separate document, begin analyzing the passage you've chosen. Work through an **observation, problem,** and **claim** and **build up** your support by looking closely at the text. Also explore a potential **motive** for your reading.

If you are still struggling to come up with a rich interpretive problem at this point, here are some potential questions you might consider as you brainstorm:

- Why do you think the author chooses these terms to convey his or her point?
- How does the author construct a problem?
- What claims does the author make?
- What evidence does he or she provide?
- Why does the author make certain distinctions among ideas?
- Are there any assumptions that the author makes, either explicitly or implicitly?
- How does recognizing those assumptions change how we understand his or her argument?
- Why does the author choose this particular evidence or particular kind of evidence?  
- How do the author’s choices support his or her argument?
- How does evidence from the rest of the text support your interpretation of the author’s argument in this particular passage?

Here are a few more tips:

- Select a passage that requires interpretation, has terms that shift in meaning, and/or has claims that suggest significant room for debate. Don't select a passage that simply declares a basic point or sum up the author's ideas.   
- The passage may be a single sentence or several sentences long. The "passage" may also be a term/expression/image/device/question, etc. that occurs in different places throughout the essay. But you shouldn't just be piling up examples; you need to raise a _specific_ problem as a result of a _specifc_ observation.
- Remember that this is an informal document. Focus on content rather than form. Try not to stop writing even if you're not quite sure where a point may be going. Explore each potential idea and see if the very act of writing can get you to a larger claim.
- You do not need to write a formal introduction for now. Simply start by presenting your problem.
- Don't worry too much about structure, but begin a new paragraph/section every time you do something new.
- Carefully expound each transition. Do not take any logical step for granted.
