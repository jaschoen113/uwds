#P1 Exercise 4

Due Thursday 9/22  

1. Read "Revising Style"

2. Pick what you believe is the best-written paragraph in your formal draft.

2. Revise this paragraph with "Revising Style" in mind. Remember to:

  1. Express actions and conditions in specific verbs, adverbs, or adjectives.
  2. Whenever you can, make the subjects of your verbs characters involved in those actions.

3. Re-read your paragraph. Do you think your claims are still as rich, complex, and developed as they can be? Does this paragraph achieve as much argumentative weight as it can? Or do you still have a more interesting point you can make? If so, does that impact your larger argument/essay?

4. Read Orwell's "Politics and the English Language"

5. Find one of Orwell's 5 criticisms in your own essay, and revise it. This might mean just changing one word! That's fine for now. Mark the change on the Google Doc so we can discuss in class.
