##Egg and Sperm Convo
- Map out general summary/observation/claim
- Zoom into how she's close reading
- Motive and Implication and find in Martin

- Martin serves as a particularly useful model for our own essays, since she engages in close reading; for this reason, I thought we could read Martin like we did the TMR article
- What is her claim? Is it debatable? Is it original? Is it evaluative or analytical?
    - Note that though it is _critical_ it is not evaluative; it does not simply say that the biology textbooks are "weak" or "illogical;" it also doesn't use this rhetorical problem to take down the larger point of the biology textbooks (it's not claiming their science is faulty as a result); it is critical but also analytical -- it looks at the various parts of these texts, and builds its own original claim around those parts; it constructs a new argument   
- How does she support her claim? How does she perform close readings? How much of the text does she need to quote? How much context does she provide? Ask the class for the passage they chose
    - Note that she uses various amounts of text when necessary. But usually when she includes a larger quote, she returns to that quote from a microscopic level -- she then points the reader to the specific language she's looking at within that quote
    - Nearly every paragraph has evidence in it, mostly in the form of quotes
- What is her **motive**? How does she make the clear for the readers? Why should we keep **reading** her argument?
    - "Part if my goal..." note that it is specific (not some general motive about gender or biology, but their intersection), but also shows that it is a specific problem worth investigating
- What are the **implications** of her argument? What might happen if we **believe** her argument?
    - We would be able to do better science and shake these stereotypes
- How does she transition between ideas on the sentence level? On the paragraph level?

##TMR Convo
- Worksheet with partner
- Map out summary/observation/claim
- Outline if time

- Let's try to reconstruct how the argument develops:
  - What passage selected? Why is this a passage worth examining? What makes it special, what makes it complicate the text at large?
    - The question, "do monsters really exist?" It potentially undermines the larger argument, making it an exceptional and important part of the piece. She can read its form (as a question), she can also read its language (symptom, anxiety, etc).
  - How does the writer close read the passage? Look at specific moments of close reading
    - Looks at specific words like "surely" and "perhaps"; also looks at the form of the question ("Cohen demands a definite answer")
  - How does the writer connect the writing to the meaning of the passage? How does a close examination of form, word choice, rhetorical moves lead to a deeper understanding of the text?
    - Links confident language to playing with our egos (increasing our anxiety, something investigated in the theory), links language of anxiety to anxiety, links to indeterminacy of the question to anxiety
  - What is the main argument of this piece? Where is it?
    - The question is really testing reader's level of thought and whether they will give in easily to a certain argument because they are uneasy; this readerly anxiety parallels the anxiety of the monster; and this kind of anxiety reinforces unthought  
  - How does the writer introduce the larger project of "Monster Culture"? How much context does she give? How much does she use the rest of the text (parts that are not from her passage)?
    - Mostly in the second paragraph; lays out main project, primary investigation, even describes academic tone; gives enough information about his argument/tone so that the reader will understand argument later on (i.e. relationship between anxiety and monsters)
  - How might you describe this essay's structure?
    - introduction, context, passage, back-up/tone, close reading/building anticipation, close reading/proding ego, close reading/anxiety, lays out claim/connects close readings, conclusion/re-articulating claim/moving onto implications
  - How would you describe the tone and style of the piece?
    - mostly scholarly, occasionally dramatized
  - What kind of audience do you think this piece is directed towards? Who might be interested in this piece?
    - people who have read "monster culture", people who are interested in "anxious reading", people interested in rhetorical questions, people interested in how authors engage/affect their audiences  

##Workshop discussion
- Reread the handout
- Discuss good/bad workshop feedback
- Show how to do it again in Google Docs - remember two marginal notes and a end comment
