##Exhibit Lesson (20 minutes)
- First part of P2 is identifying conversation, second part is choosing an "exhibit" to analyze. In P1, the essay you selected was your exhibit. But for P2, your exhibit can be practically anything. No matter what kind of exhibit you select, you'll still be close reading it. I want to consider the different kinds of close reading we do across different forms of exhibits.

Poetry/Art Pairings:
  - "I saw the figure 5 in gold" painting by Charles Demuth with "The Great Figure" by William Carlos Williams
  - Poem: What kinds of images are we seeing? Why do we think the poem has so few words on each line? What is the effect of this shortness? What sense do we get from it? What can we say about the first person perspective? How does time/motion work in this poem? How does language/word choice evoke other sensations?
  - Painting: What images are standing out here? How does time work here? What do we make of the colors? How is space being warped? What is in the background vs the foreground? Do you notice any parallel images? What is the effect of seeing the three fives at once? What view do you think we have here? Where are we looking from, at? What is our perspective? What do we make of the fonts, at the text in this piece?
