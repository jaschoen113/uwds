##Free write
- Take a couple minutes to free write about research process so far:
  - What are you finding difficult about research so far? Any specific kind of source you're having trouble finding?
  - What has worked for you so far? Any search terms, fields, or strategies that delivered better results?
  - Have you found some databases more useful or less useful?
  - Do you have a skim-reading strategy?  How much time are you spending reading over sources?
  - How are you determining which sources to keep/not keep?
  - What is your note-taking strategy?

##Volunteer Topic, Question, Problem Workshop: 20 minutes, 10 min each
- Get 2-3 depending on time volunteers. Put on board. Divide board, have them write out their own:
  - Topic
  - Question
  - Problem
  - Kinds of sources you've found
- Look at the second exercise from last week that we didn't go to. (Print extras)
- Think about these questions for topic/question/problem. For sources, think about what kinds of sources you imagine might be useful and where they might look for them.
- Workshop the topic, question, problem according to criteria, but also brainstorm kinds of sources that might be useful (and where to go)
