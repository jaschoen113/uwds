##Writing Prompt
- In what ways can Hofstadter's essay help us to think about our own writing (writing style, process, argument, etc)? (Hint: look at moments where he's being meta about writing the essay, his discussions about creativity, etc)

##Hofstadter and Conversation (20 minutes)
- There are two main tasks for P2 (we'll talk about the second one on Tuesday). The first one though, is that you'll be identifying an intellectual conversation between two assigned essays. An "intellectual or academic conversation" is simply a topic that more than one writer discusses--they might discuss the topic similarly or differently, they might agree or disagree on an argument about the topic, they might use different examples to discuss the same topic, they might reference each other or they may have never read each other. Identifying larger conversations between two or more writers helps us to think about each individual writer's ideas in new ways, and also allows us to reach new ideas after placing the writers alongside each other.
- What I want to do now is identify the various academic conversations that Hofstadter enters. In partners, take a few minutes to go through the essay and make a list of them. One way of thinking about this is, if you were to tag this essay on a website, what tags or categories would you assign to it? Another great place to look is when he quotes other people -- whatever topic they're discussing, he's in conversation with as well.
- Make list on board of Hofstadter's conversations
- Now, do any of these conversations intersect with Turing, Ford, or Jamison?
