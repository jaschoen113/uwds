If time: Watch Sunspring (15 minutes)
- Watch "Sunspring" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY7x2Ihqjmc)
- As we're watching, try to jot down at least one moment that you might be worth exploring in detail; this could be a line/dialogue that is particularly strange or something about the cinematography (so visual effects, costumes, music, acting, film editing, etc); after we're done watching i'll give you a couple minutes to flesh out some ideas about it
- Free-write: what is particularly striking to you about this moment? how might it comment on the greater project of the film? either to do with AI or just the larger narrative of the story?
