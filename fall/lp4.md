##Writing Prompt
- How might you define close reading? Why do you think it's a valuable skill? Why is it difficult? Any other thoughts on close reading

##Questions about Turing close reading?
- Do we want to go over that again since it was rushed?
Summary: Machines will be able to mimic the behavior of humans in the future.  
Observation: Within Turing's counter-argument, he links certain counter-argument back to a previous counter-argument, referring the reader back to the previous argument (bottom of p. 449, top of p. 451)
Claim: This creates a kind of loop within Turing's counter-argument, where "smart" objections are revealed to be the same objections over and over again. The objector then, is like a machine caught in a loop. As the objector is like a machine himself, Turing bolsters his argument that machines and humans may not be so indistinguishable.
Alternative claim: Turing himself seems to be in a loop

##Jamison Presentation and Discussion (35 min)
- Additional questions:  
- Where are moments of ethos, pathos, logos in this piece?
- Can we think about these rhetorical moves in relation to her larger exploration of empathy?
- How does she use pronouns to play with the idea of empathy?
- What is the effect of the script structure?
- What are some recurring images in this text?
- Why might she hold the heart surgery off from us? Does that feel reconciled? Is there a protectiveness there, as she describes?

##Motif Close Reading (20 min)
- Like the Turing exercise we did last class, let's select one pattern.
- First let's identify the pattern; what is the meaning of the pattern? let's identify the various points it occurs
- Then let's try to exhaust observations of this pattern: Does the pattern change over time, does it stay the same? What is the effect of the pattern? What kind of images, words, structure is at play throughout the pattern?
- Now let's try to move to a claim; can we couple any of these observations with a larger idea at play in the essay? Do any of these observations bring us to reading the text differently than before we had closely examined the pattern in detail?

##Note on discussion questions
- Instead of "what do you think about?" "do you agree/disagree with?" aim for "why might the writer..." "how does the writer's use of... effect... " the first kind of question encourages more evaluative discussions (us discussing the merit of the argument) the second kind encourages more analytical discussions (us discussing the writing). The first kind of response tends to come up anyway, and often is an interesting conversation. But since we're a writing class, we really want to move towards the second kind of response.  

##Explain exploratory draft (10 minutes)
- Point is to really explore ideas through writing

##For Tuesday
- Read Martin and TMR, both model texts for P1 (one is an actual UW paper, one is an academic article that has strong close reading)
- For each, try to map out what the summary/observation/claim is (don't close read them, but try to map out how their close reading works)
- For TMR article, for example, Summary/Observation/Claim will be about the essay she's discussing (Cohen) Cohen says, Cohen does, ...
- In the margins of TMR article, briefly recap what each paragraph is *doing* and *saying* (introducing main argument, that x.... ; providing background information, on.... )
