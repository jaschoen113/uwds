##Writing prompt
- What makes for a good discussion (in class, between friends, etc)? What inhibits good discussion?

##Another icebreaker (5 minutes)
- Spirit animal :) (5 minutes)

##Admin
- Issues with site? Do we all understand how to access the Site, get the readings, etc?

##Discussion Rules
- Discuss free-write about discussion
My rules:
- Say name of person before you
- Don't just say what you want to say and ignore person before you, try your best to connect your idea to theirs, or wait until the current idea has transformed/changed naturally

##Presentation (5 minutes)
- Model presentation for Ford:
- Richard Ford is an African American law professor at Stanford University.  He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991, and before becoming a professor he worked at private firm and also on housing policy for Cambridge, MA. As he mentions in the intro to this essay, his expertise is in civil rights and anti-discrimination law. Ford's views on these issues might best be described as centrist or moderate. He typically argues for pragmatic measures, rather than ideologically pure ones, to solve various human rights and racial injustice issues. For example, in his book "Universal Rights Down to Earth," he argues that ideals about human rights often worsen human rights abuses, since idealism sometimes stop activists from negotiating for incremental change, or enforcing certain human rights might lead to other human rights violations. In his book "The Race Card," he argues that excessively widespread accusations of racism distract from genuine problems of racial discrimination. He advocates for long-term, systemic solutions to the most significant racial injustices over concern for instances of more  "ambiguous bias." We might think about his tendency to approach certain ideologies from a more moderate and ambiguous perspective influences his approach in "Save the Robots." We also might consider how his usual belief in a more pragmatic, negotiated route to achieve equality might relate to his suggestions in this essay. Also, it's worth noting that this article is published in The Stanford Law Review, the student-run law journal at Stanford whose main audience is legal students, lawyers, and legal scholars. We should also keep in mind that this article was published in 2000, which I believe is about the same year some of you were born. At that time, companies like Amazon were certainly already becoming power-houses, but just as a simple comparison, it made 2.8 billion in 2000 and 135 billion in 2016.

- Reflection on presentation: about 5 minutes, a little more, or a little less - but it wasn't a minute, and definitely wasn't 15 minutes. read several articles on nyt and new yorker about his books, listened to an interview with him, to get a better sense of his general views. i tried to then link what i've learned to a question about how we might consider the essay accordingly. also thought relevant to mention the publication, and fact about the industry. the exact kind of information i presented might not be the most relevant or available for all the essays - not a strict formula for the presentations, you want to do research to figure out what's most relevant. sometimes might be more useful to talk about background on something in the essay, or the general field. i spent about an hour reading various articles and doing research for these 5 minutes.

##Questions (20 minutes)
- First question is a "content" question. In the beginning of his essay, Ford insists on the "ambiguities and ambulances" of his argument (page 1575). 1) Can we identify those ambiguities? What might Ford say is ambiguous about the doppelganger? 2) Why might it be important for Ford to forefront the ambiguity of his argument? What does that mean for his larger argument?
    - Means that we have a harder time distinguishing his actual beliefs (he even admits he feels ambivalent about it), which in a way parallels the increasingly blurred boundary between human and machine in his scenario (hard to tell difference between machine and human || hard to tell what Ford, or we, really feel about this)
- Second question is "formal" question. 1) How would you identify Ford's "voice" or "tone", particularly in the second section of the essay? How is he addressing the reader? How does that voice differ from the rest of the essay? 2) And how might we connect that voice to the content at hand?
    - sarcastic, funny, aggressive
    - sarcasm, once again, is an ambiguous form - we get the sense that he's joking, but we might not be entirely sure that he is
    - his aggressiveness when he's "playing devil's advocate" for the machine mimics the machine's aggressiveness, a kind of passive aggressiveness which lulls you in
- 1) I'm sure you noticed that Ford changes his fonts throughout the essay. He also appears to be narrating some kind of time-line with various "minutes in the future." Did you notice any kind of significant connection between his fonts and the timescale? Or between his font changes and the content in general? 2) And if so, or if not, what might be the significance of the font changes?
    - Certain ideas about what looks more futuristic/robotic/human, but can we communicate why exactly? Perhaps boundary is blurred
    - Timescale doesn't seem like very much (just minutes), which emphasizes how quickly things will change
    - not always a clear connection to the content - again, we have difficulty discerning, which parallels the difficulty in discerning difference between human and machine
- At the end of his essay, Ford rather quickly suggests that we "choose our future now," and suggests a few means (boycotts, legislation, consumer action). 1) Do we think that Ford really believes we can make these decisions? What in his essay might point to the possibility that we can or we can't? 2) If we think Ford is actually skeptical about autonomy in the rest of the essay, why be optimistic here? Is this just a contradiction?
    - He had just pointed out in the thought experiment that when we "think" we have autonomy, we don't really (when we think we're still in control because we've decided to sign up for the doppelganger, we're not really in control because society has made it so we don't really have a choice, and it's a feedback loop)
    - Perhaps not just a contradiction, but once again lulling us into believing we can make a change

##Close Reading Exercise
- Again, summary/observation/claim
- We can draw directly from our discussion, ie:
Summary (7 year old): Ford argues that cyber doppelgangers will slowly take away our autonomy unless we do something about it now
Observation (undeniable): Ford uses an exaggerated, aggressive narrative voice in his thought experiment
Claim (debatable): The voice lulls the reader into complacency like the doppelganger will, and reiterates our lack of control [one could argue that Ford really wants the reader to resist that aggressive voice, which just proves that we aren't so complacent after all, empowering us to make change now]

Observation (undeniable): Ford puts forth practical suggestions at the end
Claim (debatable): Ford's suggestions are not to be taken seriously, since he has already proven that we don't really have autonomy, and so they just re-illustrate our gullible sense of autonomy [counter: Ford's suggestions are meant to be taken seriously, just because autonomy can be taken away, doesn't mean it definitely will be taken away]
