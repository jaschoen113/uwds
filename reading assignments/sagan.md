### Reading Response 14: Carl Sagan, "Pale Blue Dot"

How does Sagan engage his reader in this essay? Identify a rhetorical move (a single moment or a recurring motif) that activates a response from the reader; identify that response as well. Then think about why Sagan might be choosing to appeal to the reader in this way, as opposed to any other way. Short pieces like this essay (and your op-eds) usually implement one such strategy effectively, rather than many strategies less effectively. How might you use such a strategy in your own op-ed?
