What can you say about both the image and "Dr. Daedalus" by reading them side-by-side? How can Slater inform a close reading of the image? How does the image support, complicate, or develop an idea put forth by Slater? Use at least one quote from Slater to support your argument. Be sure to read the image closely, paying attention to detail, style, form, color, etc. You might choose to examine one specific detail, several elements, or a larger pattern of the image.
