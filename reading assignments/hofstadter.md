### Reading Response 4: Douglas Hofstadter, "On the Seeming Paradox of Mechanized Creativity"

Find a key term to define and close read. The term should be one that Hofstadter relies on more than once. It might be a term that he defines himself, a term that he creates himself, or a term that he uses without specific acknowledgment. Look for a term whose definition (whether or not Hofstadter himself defines it) plays a large role in his argument. It might be a term that you've never heard of, or a term that you use everyday (but whose exact definition is still arguable).  

Type up the term. First, in **your own words** (don't quote), write out a definition for the word according to how its used in the essay. Then explain what this definition means for Hofstadter's essay at large (you can use quotes, sparingly, for this part of the response). You might think about the following: How does this definition narrow or expand the limits of his claims? How might his argument be different if he used the term differently? If it is a term Hofstadter himself has not defined, how did you gather this definition? If it is a term that Hofstadter has defined, why does he make a point of definition? Is the term used consistently throughout the essay? Does it take on different meanings at different times? How does the term interact with other key terms in the essay?
