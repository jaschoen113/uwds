### Reading Response 5: Oliver Sacks, "Anthropologist on Mars"

Find a passage (1-4 sentences) where Sacks' essay resonates with any of the essays we've read so far this semester (Turing, Jamison, Martin, Hofstadter). This might be an obvious or non-obvious connection. It might be via a single term or a larger idea. It might between an explicit argument in one piece and your own close reading in another piece. Look for any moment that reminded you *in any way* to an earlier essay.

Quote and/or paraphrase the Sacks passage and the corresponding passage from the other essay (just be thoughtful: don't leave out important words, but don't include unnecessary quotes to fill space). Then, describe how you see the two essays colliding. You might think about the following: What question(s) are they both circling around? How do they use similar or different images to elucidate the same idea? How do they use similar images to elucidate different ideas? Do they approach the same topic from different points of view? Or with different tones, styles, or forms? Can reading one author develop or complicate a close reading of the other author? Where do they agree? Where do they disagree? How might both perspectives be consolidated?
