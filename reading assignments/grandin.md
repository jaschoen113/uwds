### Reading Response 6: Temple Grandin, "Animals are not things"

Place the Grandin and Sacks essays in conversation with each other in some way. You can stage this conversaton in numerous ways. For example, you might focus on how they approach similar topics in different styles and tones. Or you might focus on two moments that conflict with each other across the essays. Or you might think about how one text illuminates the ideas of the other. Keep in mind that relationships between ideas and texts are usually not black and white, but more often nuanced and complicated. Our goal is to flesh out these complications rather than simplify them. Use quotes and paraphrasing when necessary to support your comparison.
