### Reading Response 3: Emily Martin, "The Egg and the Sperm: How Science Has Constructed a Romance Based on Stereotypical Male-Female Roles."

Find a moment when Martin herself close reads. She might be looking closely at one word in one text or at a larger pattern in several texts. Try to find a passage that is 1-5 sentences long. Look for a close reading that you found particularly intriguing, surprising, and/or convincing.

Type up the passage (if you need to skip over some of her language, you can use ellipsis [...]). Then, in response, try to describe what makes Martin's close reading so effective in this passage. What is her observation about the language/form of the text? Why are the moments that she has selected worth close reading? How does she illustrate her observation to a reader who has not read the entire text she is reading? How does she move from an observation to a claim? In other words, how does she relate her observation about language/form to a larger point? How is her claim contestable yet supportable?

Copy and paste this response in the "Martin" Google Doc in the Reading Response folder on the Google Site. Make sure to include your name first (in bold).
