### Reading Response 1: Alan Turing, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence"

Carefully choose a short passage that youâ€™d like to close read. The passage should be 1-4 sentences long. You should look for a moment that is stylistically and/or formally rich--a place where Turing's language and/or form complicates his meaning. This might be a passage that you found confusing, a passage that you found unnerving or strange, or a passage that surprised or excited you. Underline words and phrases that are especially resonant; think about the meaning and purpose of the passage, individually and within the context of the larger paper.

Type up the **entire passage**. Then, underneath, write your **observation**(s)--what is unique about this passage? What are particularly noteworthy words or phrases? Why are they noteworthy? Or is Turing's structure or form noteworthy in this passage? And why? Then build a **claim** off that observation--what is the effect of Turing's style/form/language in this passage? How does your observation relate to or complicate the larger point he is making in this passage? How does it relate to or complicate the larger point he makes in this paper?
