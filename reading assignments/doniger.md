### Reading Response 10: Wendy Doniger, "Many Masks, Many Selves"

Imagine that you were to use Doniger as a conceptual framework for your P3 essay. Often a conceptual framework does not specifically reference your topic of interest (here, virtual reality). But it presents a series of theoretical questions and claims that can be applied to your own project. How could you use Doniger to read your VR exhibit? And how might your VR exhibit develop or complicate Doniger's argument(s)? Try to include a specific quote (or two) from Doniger that supports your claim. If you think that your VR exhibit has no intersection with any questions raised by Doniger, then choose another VR experience you encountered when selecting your exhibit or discuss VR more generally.
