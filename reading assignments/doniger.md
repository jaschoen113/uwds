### Reading Response 10: Wendy Doniger, "Many Masks, Many Selves"

Imagine that you were to use Doniger as a conceptual framework for your P3 essay. Often a conceptual framework does not specifically reference your topic of interest (here, virtual reality). But it presents a series of theoretical questions and claims that can be applied to your own project. How could you use Doniger to discuss VR? And how might a discussion of VR develop or complicate Doniger's argument(s)? Try to include a specific quote (or two) from Doniger that supports your claim.
