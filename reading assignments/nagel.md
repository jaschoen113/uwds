### Reading Response 12: Thomas Nagel, "What is it like to be a bat?"

Discuss Nagel's style in this essay. By style, I mean tone, vocabulary, grammar, etc. You might think about the following: How does his style differ from other essays we've read this semester? What kind of expected audience does it signal? Might it have a rhetorical purpose? What are the benefits/drawbacks of such a style? Can you find any connection between Nagel's style and his argument in this piece?
