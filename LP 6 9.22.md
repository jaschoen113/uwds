- Style examples (15 minutes)
- Work with two formal paragraphs (10 minutes)

##Clip (10 min)
- History of English Language Animation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3r9bOkYW9s
- Why should we care about grammar, spelling, and vocab when our language has always been evolving? (we will discuss this some more with Orwell)

##Style Discussion (20 min)
- Now that you've started your formal draft, I'd like to take today to talk about writing style. So far we've mostly focused on close reading a text, developing a sophisticated argument, and laying down the larger essay structure. But it is also important to think about your writing on the sentence level. Though grammar might seem like an arbitrary construct and style might seem like a highly subjective judgment--and often you will find different professors have different stylistic preferences--developing style and clarity in your writing is essential in order to effectively communicate with your audience and further clarify your own argument. Trimming your language down to its essentials eliminates redundancies and rhetorical crutches, establishing your actual points and revealing weak spots in your argument. Today we're going to think about the significance of our writing styles and then work through some style strategies.
- Bring out the Orwell piece that you were assigned. Take a couple minutes to free write in response to Orwell, potentially answering the following questions:
  - What do you think of Orwell's claim that bad English produces bad thoughts?
  - Do you sympathize more with Orwell's linguistic conservatism or with those who argue that such undertakings are "archaic," as he puts it? Is there a possible in between?
  - What do you think of the connection Orwell makes between writing and politics?
  - Do you find any of his five criticisms useful? Have they made you rethink your own writing style?
- Come back together and discuss the Orwell/the importance of style

##Discuss Reader vs Writer Based Prose (20 min)
- Now let's turn the Flower reading. I want you to look through the Flower again and take a couple minutes to answer the following questions:
  - What are the key differences between reader and writer based prose?
  - What strategies can you implement in your own writing?
  - What do you imagine is difficult about writing reader-based prose?
- Come back together and discuss

##Go through sample passages (15 min)
- Pass out handout of some sample passages; identify reader vs writer based sentences; select a few bad sentences and rewrite them together on the board

##Work with two formal paragraphs (10 min)
- Now let's work on the two formal paragraphs you wrote for homework. Take the last fifteen minutes to identify: any of Orwell's 5 criticisms, any instances of writer instead of reader based prose, any other stylistic issues that came up in discussion. Circle sentences you want to re-write or begin to rewrite them now.
- Your formal draft is due Wednesday and you'll be  revising one paragraph for Thursday's class. It's important to keep style and revising in mind throughout the formal draft process; reworking your wording _as_ you write your drafts means reworking your ideas and solidifying your arguments. We'll be discussing revising more on Thursday since revision is such a critical part of the writing process.
