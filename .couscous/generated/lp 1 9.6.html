<h2 id="brief-introduction-5-mins">Brief Introduction (5 mins)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Introduce myself</li>
<li>Welcome to University Writing - a class designed to introduce undergrads to academic writing and develop fundamental writing skills. Our section is specifically Data Sciences and Engineering themed, meaning that we will be reading texts that feed into academic debates specifically concerning the science and engineering community, but also, as you will see, asking more universal questions. I'm going to go over the goals of this class and what our themed section means in a couple minutes. But first I want us to start getting to know each other.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ice-breaker-10-mins">Ice Breaker (10 mins)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Since this is a seminar much of our class will be discussion-based, and we will also be reading each other's writing and constantly engaging with each other's ideas. So it is important that we get to know each other.</li>
<li>Play name-game (ask if their names have any story attached to them, if not it's fine) - make everyone say the name that came before (then I'll try)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-goals-15-minutes">Course Goals (15 minutes)</h2>
<p>(3 minutes)</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay now, I want us to start thinking about the the goals of this course.</li>
<li>We will be learning how to write academic papers. Since academic writing can greatly vary across disciplines, this class will not prepare you for a specific kind of academic writing. Rather, we will be developing fundamental skills that you can carry across disciplines. Since we are focused on academic writing, our assumed audience will be smart academic readers--in other words, your peers in this room, in your other classes, and in your future academic environments.</li>
<li>Since this class is themed &quot;Data Sciences and Engineering&quot;, all of our reading will be engaging with academic conversations around data sciences and engineering. This means that your essays - which will be working with our readings - will be engaging with those conversations. So we can think of the theme as a kind of inspiration for our writing, though the primary goal of this class is to work on writing itself. This class does not presume any knowledge of science or engineering, or any intention of majoring in science or engineering. I myself am studying medieval English literature, so my specialty pretty far removed from modern technology. But I am still very interested in these present technological debates, as I hope you will be as you read our primary texts. To me, the most important part of the writing process is selecting a topic that interests you, and finding that interest even in conversations that you might never have considered interesting before. So, even if you have no explicit interest in data science or engineering, I am confident you will find something interesting in our readings and discussions to passionately write about in your essays.</li>
</ul>
<p>(5 minutes)</p>
<p>Now, what are our specific writing goals for this class?</p>
<p>I want us to take a couple minutes to reflect on our writing. Please get a sheet of paper to write on, and for the next couple minutes I want you to write a response to one or two or all of these questions:</p>
<p>1) What do you find most difficult about writing?
2) Has anyone ever told you something about your writing that you agree you need to work on?
3) What are you worried about in transitioning your writing from high school level to undergraduate level?</p>
<p>We're going to be doing a lot of free-writing like this in class. The goal here is to really &quot;word vomit.&quot; Don't go for polished writing - just write whatever comes to your mind. I'll never cold call on you to read out what you've written. This exercise serves mainly as a springboard for our discussions.</p>
<p>(8 minutes)</p>
<p>Does anyone want to share anything they've come up with? (repeat questions); if no one volunteers, say something I want to work on with my own writing to open things up (i.e. revise my drafts more boldly/kill my darlings)</p>
<p>Some possible goals to bring up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write essays that an audience would want to read based on the strength and originality of their ideas, Accurate and insightful work with sources, and formal coherence (even beauty)</li>
<li>Anticipate and fulfill expectations of readers of your essays</li>
<li>Read actively, annotate source material, and take notes that will help you at later stages of writing</li>
<li>Present, analyze, reflect on sources and cite them</li>
<li>Adopt a problem- and inquiry-based approach to finding a project of your own</li>
<li>Propose, assess, and revise an academic writing project</li>
<li>Generate your own ideas in relationship to source materials that you encounter</li>
<li>Choose from common formal structures at the sentence, paragraph, and section levels and invent new ones</li>
<li>Provide, receive, and incorporate the responses of other writers to your work</li>
<li>Radically revise your drafts, postponing the moment at which your work on an essay is complete</li>
<li>Proofread and refine the most public versions of your work</li>
<li>Reflect on your own preferences and habits as a reader, writer, speaker, and thinker in order to sustain and enhance those that are helpful to you and to change or eliminate those that are blocking your development</li>
<li>Adopt multiple roles in a seminar setting to enrich discussion, support the intellectual community of a class, and listen with purpose</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="syllabus-overview-15-min">Syllabus Overview (15 min)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read through syllabus with them, highlighting the 4 progressions, the 3 themes (animal rights, artificial intelligence, posthumanism), the different draft versions, the purpose of exercises, general admin (google site vs courseworks vs hardcopy), conferences, office hours</p>
</li>
<li>Blurb about progressions: in P1, you will write about a single essay, identifying a textual problem or question and answering it through close reading of the content and form of the essay. the goal of this essay is to deepen our understanding of the value or implications of a single rich text by extending its work or by filling in its gaps. in P2, you will read a set of scholarly texts with rich definitions, concepts, and oppositions. you will then select two of these texts to read in terms of each other. the goal of this progression is to illuminate our understanding of these texts in a way that can only be accomplished by reading them side by side. in P3, you will read a major text which raises a series of questions, and in response to one of those questions, present a textual problem in an exhibit of your own choosing. the goal of this progression is to develop a research project of your own that engages with contemporary scholarship. in p4, you will write an opinion piece that would be suitable for publication. the goal of this progression is to develop a compelling, unique authorial voice.</li>
</ul>
<p>-Blurb about theme progressions: as you will see, each progression builds off each other; we will develop writerly and readerly skills in progression one that will then be supplemented and complicated in progression two, then added to in progression three, etc. in addition, our readings will lead us through various aspects of a large intellectual debate, building off questions that previous readings raised, and by the end of the course you will hopefully come to think about intelligence, species, machines, humans, and data in new and exciting lights. we will begin, in progression one, by considering the differences, similarities, and boundaries between animal and human intelligence, and the ethical implications of such considerations. after considering whether other species are intelligent, and whether that or other factors should affect our treatment of them, we will then step back to ask - what is intelligence exactly? how do you measure it? can we create it artificially? so in progression two, we will be diving deeper into questions of human and machine intelligence. finally, in progression 3, we will be exploring how other systems of self and intelligence might exist beyond merely the mind; how one's body, tools, and environment play a role and maybe even help make up one's intelligence, and what that means for humans moving forward. in progression four we'll talk some more about all of these questions, and you'll have a chance to write, in an opinion piece, about one of the questions that compelled you the most in the course.</p>
<h2 id="annotation-amp-close-reading-exercise-30-minutes">Annotation &amp; Close Reading Exercise (30 minutes)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Now we're going to begin working on our writing. To write well, first we have to make sure we're reading well. In the next half hour I want to go over active reading (annotating) and close reading, a strategy that we will be developing throughout this entire class and especially in this first progression.</p>
</li>
<li>While you'll be close reading primarily academic essays in your own writing this semester, I want to start off with a poem. Poems tend to be particularly rich for close reading because of their interesting language, dynamic forms, and vibrant images. But you can apply this same practice to any form of writing, art, or media.</li>
</ul>
<p>Poem: Melville &quot;the maldive shark&quot;</p>
<p>About the Shark, phlegmatical one,
Pale sot of the Maldive sea,
The sleek little pilot-fish, azure and slim,
How alert in attendance be.
From his saw-pit of mouth, from his charnel of maw
They have nothing of harm to dread,
But liquidly glide on his ghastly flank
Or before his Gorgonian head;
Or lurk in the port of serrated teeth
In white triple tiers of glittering gates,
And there find a haven when peril’s abroad,
An asylum in jaws of the Fates!
They are friends; and friendly they guide him to prey,
Yet never partake of the treat—
Eyes and brains to the dotard lethargic and dull,
Pale ravener of horrible meat.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, let's read the poem out loud, and I just want you to think about what the poem is saying on its most basic level. If you were to summarize the poem for a 7 year old, what would you say? Feel free to annotate as we read, marking anything you find particularly important for this task. (Have someone read it out loud and come up with a basic summary, write on board)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now let's read it again. This time, I want you to read it alone, and I want you to annotate it as you go, especially if you didn't the first time (using whatever strategies you know of so far). As you read, I also want you to look for anything you find particularly striking. Is there an unexpected word or phrase? A contradictory image? An ambiguous meaning in one line? A tension between a formal element (a rhyme, the line-breaks, etc) and the meaning we've discussed? Write <strong>observation</strong>: <strong>tension</strong>, <strong>contradiction</strong>, <strong>ambiguity</strong> on the board. The observations we are looking for usually fall into these categories (other words for tension/contradiction/ambiguity = anything unnerving/illogical/strange). (Read through it again, jot down some ideas on board)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that we have our summary and our observation on the board, can we make any more solid links between the primary meaning of the poem and one of our observations? In other words, can we connect any of these observations to the larger &quot;point&quot; of the passage? Do any of these observations change/reinforce/complicate our understanding of the larger text? Given this particular observation, can you say anything more nuanced, complicated, or interesting about the entire poem itself, or a possible reading of the poem? This will be our <strong>claim</strong> (write on board in third column). If they are not answering quickly, give them a minute to jot a potential claim down.</p>
</li>
<li>Now, let's finally talk about how we marked up our text. Ask them for how they annotated the passage (collect strategies on the board), ask them for any other annotation strategies they know of, particularly for reading essays instead of poetry (write those on board as well), then add to the board any they haven't yet come up with:
<ul>
<li>underline topic sentence in paragraph</li>
<li>put question marks in margin</li>
<li>put exclamations in margin</li>
<li>star critical lines or passages</li>
<li>write questions in margins</li>
<li>add your opinion or another author's opinions in margins</li>
<li>add an outline (1, 2, 3 or a, b, c etc) for when there are points in succession</li>
<li>draw arrows between ideas</li>
<li>summarize in margins  </li>
<li>circle words you don't know/need to look up</li>
<li>bracket important concepts/key terms/other sources or authors</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="hand-out-exercise-1-last-couple-minutes">Hand out exercise 1 (last couple minutes)</h2>
<ul>
<li>I won't usually hand out exercises in class; you'll find them all online; they will always be building off what we went over in class and assigned reading, and the directions are pretty straightforward</li>
<li>For this Thursday, as you read Grandin you'll be annotating using strategies we discussed, summarizing succinctly, making an observation and a claim as we discussed in class</li>
<li>You'll also have a craft text assigned in addition to the Grandin - it's a very short article by Patricia Klein with more close reading strategies.  </li>
<li>You should think of exercises as breaking up your essay writing; they are not extra work but rather training you to apply the necessary critical strategies in your essay, and they often produce ideas and writing that feed directly and importantly into your further drafts</li>
