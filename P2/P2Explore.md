## P2 Exploratory Draft

Due Tuesday 10/11  

800-1000 words

### Objectives

1. Explore the implications of your __exhibit__ and their relevance to the issues discussed by the essays that we have read so far.
2. Discover new potential __connections__ between the essays that we have read and your exhibit.
3. Identify an initial interpretive __problem__, persuasive pieces of __evidence__, local and global __claims__, and a __motive__ for your own essay.

### Text

1. Choose one of the potential exhibits that you have explored so far. Consider again its __manageability__, its __relevance__, and its __ambivalence__.
2. Describe the exhibit adequately in your draft, presupposing a reader that may or may not be familiar with it.
3. Discuss your exhibit, its implications, and its potential connections to the assigned essays. You should refer to at least two readings from this progression; you may explore potential connections to more than two of the essays, though for the final draft you will only use two sources.  
4. Try to include the rhetorical elements that we have already used for the first progression: one **interpretive problem**, an initial **claim**, appropriate **evidence**, and a **motive**.
5. Use this draft to experiment with new ideas. Write freely and do not focus on the formal qualities of this document. Exhaust every idea, do not take anything for granted, and justify every move thoroughly.
6. Start a new paragraph whenever you change your focus. Stop only when you feel that you have reached a satisfying, surprising conclusion.
