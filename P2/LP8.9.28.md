Lesson Plan 8

Overview

- Poem close reading (10 minutes)
- Questions about Singer (10 minutes)
- Debate (40 minutes)
- Identifying rhetorical moves in Singer (20 minutes)

Poem Close Reading (10 minutes)
- What is the poem about? Are there any particular images or words that are striking? What about its form?

Singer Questions (10 minutes)
- Before we start the debate, take just a minute to look at your annotations of Singer and if there were any paragraphs you didn't understand (not anything that you found weird/interesting, but parts you actually weren't able to follow his argument) - we'll be discussing Singer via the debate so I want to move on to that as soon as possible, but I do want to first make sure we all grasped all his main ideas

Debate Prep (10 minutes)
- Proposition: "The Turing Test is a sufficient test of machine intelligence"
- Potential secondary question: "Can a machine ever think?"
- Divide class into two. Have each group discuss for ten minutes their debate strategy
- What are your strongest points? What do you anticipate the other side will bring up? What counter arguments might you start with?
- It's okay to bring in points that were not in the reading
- Going to flip a coin, and whoever wins will go first (just a very quick opening statement) so think about what point you'd want to start with, and who should start with it

Debate (20 minutes)
- No individual should monopolize the conversation
- After someone talks from one side, then the other side can respond
- I'd really like everyone to try to talk at least once

Post-debate (10 minutes)
- Okay, now that we've had the debate let's do a bit of recap
- What were the key terms that kept coming up (write on board)
- How was the debate difficult? How could we put them in conversation with each other?

Identifying Rhetorical Moves in Singer (remainder of class)
- Reread this excerpt. I want you to try to identify the main argumentative strategies. Keep in mind the craft reading you had. If you were to reverse engineer these paragraphs into a template, how would you do that?
- The moments where he is addressing another argument's, agreeing, disagreeing, doing something else, transitioning between ideas, etc - mark in the margins what he is doing from an argumentative standpoint
- Then collect them (on the board)

Reminders
- Hofstadter reading along with craft text (templates like the ones mentioned in the craft text for today)
- Also: do the neural network images, and if you particularly like yours, please send it to me! I'll make a slideshow! If you really hate yours and don't want to send it, that's fine, but you can use a generic photo and generic piece of art if you don't want to do a picture of yourself! Send it to me by Monday afternoon, it can sometimes, depending on traffic, take several hours
