Lesson Plan 9
Tuesday 2/14

Schedule:
- Sacks Presentation and Discussion (35 minutes)
- Identifying conversations (30 minutes)

Sacks conversation exercise (20 minutes)
- Reread pp. 536-8 (skim). I want you to try to identify the main argumentative strategies. Keep in mind the craft reading you had for last night and the night before. If you were to reverse engineer these paragraphs into a template, how would you do that? You can take out the craft reading as well if that would be helpful.
- Identify the moments where he is addressing another argument's, agreeing, disagreeing, semi-agreeing or disagreeing, transitioning between ideas, presenting evidence, etc - mark in the margins what he is doing from an argumentative standpoint (try not to think about the content, but rather the rhetorical moves)
- Then collect them (on the board)
