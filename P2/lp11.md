Exhibit Lesson (15 minutes)
- An exhibit can be a text, a film, an event, a performance, a speech, an image, or anything that can be interpreted and carries the potential for rich analysis. While an example merely affirms an argument, an exhibit is dynamic; indeed, the exhibit itself may raise problems with our status quo understanding.
- When looking for an exhibit you want to look for something that can be interpreted in various ways. As in P1, you want to look for something that has a tension, contradiction, or ambiguity that you can make a claim about, a claim which someone else could disagree with you on.
- For your P2 proposal, I have you consider the manageability, relevance, and ambivalence of potential exhibits.
  - Is the exhibit, or the aspect of the exhibit you are examining, too expansive or too restrictive? Can it easily be explained for an unfamiliar reader, so that you can move quickly to your interesting claims about it?
  - Does it really relate to the conversation, or do you really have to stretch to make it relate? A stretch can okay, but if you have to spend the majority of your paper simply justifying why the exhibit might be thought of as relating to artificial intelligence, and don't actually get around to fleshing out the interesting connections, then you might want to choose a more straightforward example. 
  - Finally, is the exhibit ambivalent - which is to say again, can it be interpreted in multiple different ways?
- Now I have three examples of visual art up. We're going to go through all three of them and discuss the manageability, relevance, and ambivalence of each of them

For each:
- What texts might you read this with? What conversation would you be entering?
- How relevant is it to that conversation?
- Is the exhibit ambivalent?
- Is it manageable?
