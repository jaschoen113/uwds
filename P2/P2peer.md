P2 Exploratory Draft Peer Review
Due Thursday 10/13

- Read through your peer's exploratory draft (on his/her project file in Google Drive)
- Identify moment(s) in which your peer is working towards a potentially rich interpretive problem or claim. Suggest possible ways in which your peer could push his/her ideas further in these moments
- Identify moment(s) when your peer is engaging with sources (Dennett, Turing, Searle, Hofstadter). Do you see the connection (or potential connection) between the exhibit and the source? Suggest ways in which he/she might further flesh out those connections   
- Consider whether you can see any of your peer's ideas adding something new to the current conversation on intelligence. Find a moment when your peer is coming closest to adding a new perspective to the debate (he/she might not be there yet - which is fine! - but where is he/she closest to getting there?)
- Remember to be generous in your criticism (these are **exploratory drafts**!). Non-useful comments are ones like "I don't think any of these ideas will work" or "You don't have an argument yet." Useful comments are ones like "I think this idea is potentially more fruitful than this other idea" or "You're moving towards an argument here, but haven't quite gotten there yet. You might think about..."
