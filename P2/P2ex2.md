## P2 Exercise 2

Due Tuesday 10/4

1. Read Graff and Birkenstein's "Yes/No/Okay, But"

2. Select three of the templates provided in "Yes/No/Okay, But." Fill in at least one template with the Hofstader. Fill in the other two templates using either Hofstader, Turing, or Searle.

3. Try to use at least one template in which you combine two of the three authors. So, for example, the template: "My feelings on the issue are mixed. I do support X's position that ---- , but I find Y's argument about ---- and Z's research on ---- to be equally persuasive"

4. It's okay to switch up a couple words in the templates (so if you changed "research" to "example" or "argument" in the above template)
