LP 7

Overview:

- Introduce P2 (15 minutes)
- Free-write questions about Turing (10 minutes)
- Discuss Turing (main points, questions, etc) (20-30 minutes)
- Play with Chatterbot and discuss (15-20 minutes)

Introduce P2 (15 minutes)

Initial Free-Write (10 minutes):
  - Select a difficult passage from Turing, write your best interpretation, and brainstorm why the passage is difficult to unpack
  - Select a passage/idea you find particularly intriguing or something you had never thought about before or somewhere Turing really convinced you

Discussion (20-30 minutes)
  - First let's make sure we're on the same page with most things. So what is his main claim? How does the Turing test work? What are his other large claims he makes?
  - Now what are other questions that we haven't answered yet?
  - What were the parts you found most striking, if we haven't touched on them yet?
  - What did you make of his overall writing style?
  - What about the counter-arguments? Did he address them all?
  - Do we have any other potential counter-arguments? Any particular weaknesses in his argument?

Play with Chatterbot and Discuss (15-20 minutes remaining time)
  - What kinds of questions did you ask?
  - What kinds of responses did you get?
  - Why do you think certain questions are more difficult than others?
