## Progression two: Conversation Essay

Draft Deadlines:

Exploratory draft due: Tuesday 10/11  

Formal draft due: Tuesday 10/18

Final draft due: Friday 10/28   

Prompt:

Find an **exhibit** (see note below) that explores the question of artificial intelligence in some way. Select **two** of the four **assigned P2 readings** as critical sources to discuss your exhibit.

In the first progression, you considered a passage from one writer’s essay and leveraged its claims and methods to construct an intellectual problem and argument of your own. In this essay, you will use those skills—and also build on them. Instead of a selected passage serving as your exhibit, you will be analyzing an external exhibit source. Your exhibit should sit at the intersection of a dialogue between texts, mediating between them and helping you to draw out their nuances. You will use other sources to see what ideas, arguments or insights emerge from the interaction of their key concepts. By orchestrating and contributing to a scholarly conversation surrounding artificial intelligence, your essay should bring the reader to a new understanding of your exhibit in relation to that conversation.

An **exhibit** can be a text, a film, an event, a performance, a speech, an image, or anything that can be interpreted and carries the potential for rich analysis. We use the term “exhibit” rather than “example” to connote a site of sustained and expansive engagement. While an example merely affirms an argument, an exhibit is dynamic; indeed, the exhibit itself may raise problems with our status quo understanding. Through careful analysis, our developing ideas about the exhibit may change or challenge our initial assumptions.


Length:
The paper should be __1500-2000__ words long (include a word count at the end of each draft).

Goals:

- Continue to work on the goals from the first assignment: using the introduction to orient the reader and identify an **interpretive problem**; formulating a strong **claim**; establishing a **motive**; maintaining a coherent **structure**; using **evidence** fairly and persuasively.
- Choose an **exhibit** that raises an interesting **interpretive problem** and **adds** a dynamic nuance to the **current conversation** around artificial intelligence.
- Integrate your **sources** with deliberation and purpose.  The sources can be used to establish the motive, provide key terms, support your claim, or argue with other interpretations.  Document sources using the **MLA in-text citation** method.  Include a **works cited** page.  Practice **ICE:** introduce, cite, explain.
