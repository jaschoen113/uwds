Reverse Engineer TMR Essay
- Collect outline on the board
- Purpose of each paragraph, for example: presents claim, introduces evidence, provides counter-argument; also any more specific information as necessary (claim)
- Emphasis that she incorporates the sources but ultimately forges her own argument - she doesn't just reiterate any one of the sources; she uses a close reading to both demonstrate and flesh out her claim further; she's engaging in the conversation, but showing how her exhibit is worth discussing in the conversation; she's not evaluating the conversation, or evaluating her sources, nor is she evaluating her exhibit; she's **analyzing** her exhibit and its relation to the ideas in the sources 

Handout Applied to TMR Essay
