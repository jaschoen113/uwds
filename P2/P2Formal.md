## P2 Formal Draft

Due Thursday 10/18  

1100-1400 words

1. Write a working **title** and a **beginning** for your essay’s formal draft (no more than a page). Beginnings of essays serve two overarching purposes: they establish a relationship with your readers, and they invite readers to follow your argument. Keep in mind that your introduction will evolve as your writing evolves.

2. Somewhere in this beginning, present your **exhibit**, giving enough context that an intelligent reader who is unfamiliar with this exhibit would understand the project you wish to pursue in this essay. This is a good place to raise some of the **interpretive problems** that guide your inquiry, and to propose some **initial claims** you will explore in the body of the essay.

3. Draft the **middle** and tentative **ending** of your essay. Build off your exploratory draft, developing formal paragraphs out of the most productive ideas in that draft. Feel free to form new paragraphs out of new ideas.

4. Remember that the structure of your essay will have an internal logic. At the medium scale, a reader should be able to see a claim develop over the space of a paragraph. At the large scale, a reader should be able to see your linked claims building the project of your essay.

5. Your analysis of the exhibit should be grounded in details about the exhibit itself. When you ask yourself guiding questions (e.g. “What do these critical sources illuminate about my exhibit? What does my exhibit illuminate about my critical sources?”), your answers should draw on specific aspects of the exhibit and specific quotes from the texts we’ve read.

6. The exhibit that you choose is crucial to this assignment; the exhibit should lie at the crux of your two critical sources, mediating the texts and helping you to draw out their nuances. The sources, in return, should bolster and complicate your reading of the exhibit.
