P2 Exercise 4

- Read the two TMR articles, "The Giddiness of Performance" and "Brainy or Busty?"
- In the margins, identify the purpose of each paragraph, for example: presents claim, introduces evidence, provides counter-argument
- When necessary add more details, for example: presents the interpretive problem (x) or presents the counter-argument (y) [where x and y are brief summaries of the author's ideas]

- We'll be using these marginal comments to reverse engineer the TMR essay as we did for P1, so it may be helpful to look over your notes from that lesson to see how we labeled those paragraphs
