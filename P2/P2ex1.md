## P2 Exercise 1

Due Thursday 9/29

Prepare for our in class "debate" on Turing vs Searle.

1. List (bullet-points are fine) the strongest arguments Turing makes for the possibility of machine intelligence.

2. List Searle's strongest arguments for why a program cannot think.

3. Add your own ideas to these lists, expanding on any points that you think Searle or Turing could have explored further or are missing entirely.

4. Try to find specific points where Searle is responding directly to Turing (or where you think Turing is anticipating an argument like Searle's).

5. Think about whether Searle and Turing are arguing over the same point, and whether you can navigate the debate around the same point. In other words, does Searle's Chinese Room Experiment actually disprove Turing, or does it redirect the conversation elsewhere? Or does Turing's argument still prevail, even considering the Chinese Room Experiment?
