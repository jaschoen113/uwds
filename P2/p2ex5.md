Due Thursday 10/21

1. Revise your formal draft according to the comments you received from your peers in class on Tuesday. Even if this means making large-scale changes (complete restructuring, deleting and adding new close readings, developing a new claim), try to revise as much as possible so that your peer review on Thursday and my comments on your formal draft will be as helpful as possible.
2. Read Harris' "Revising" and write a formal draft abstract as he suggests. Summarize your goals, the materials youâ€™re working on, and the moves you make with those materials. Place this abstract right before your formal draft.
3. List questions that you have for your peer-reviewer or specific areas you want them to examine. Possible questions might be:
  - Do you think my essay adds a new perspective to the AI conversation?
  - Do you think I'm using x source sufficiently? Do you understand how my claim relates to his?
  - Do you follow x close reading in my 3rd paragraph?
If it would be helpful, you can mark certain moments in the margins that you'd like your peer-reviewer to focus on, or you can just list questions before your draft and after your abstract.
