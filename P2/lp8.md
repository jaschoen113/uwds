P1 Workshop (30 minutes)

Introduce P2 (15 minutes)
- Go over prompt and checklist

TMR articles (30 minutes)
- Identify argument, exhibit, conversation 
- Purpose of each paragraph, for example: presents claim, introduces evidence, provides counter-argument; also any more specific information as necessary (claim)
- Emphasize that she incorporates the sources but ultimately forges her own argument - she doesn't just reiterate any one of the sources; she uses a close reading to both demonstrate and flesh out her claim further; she's engaging in the conversation, but showing how her exhibit is worth discussing in the conversation; she's not evaluating the conversation, or evaluating her sources, nor is she evaluating her exhibit; she's **analyzing** her exhibit and its relation to the ideas in the sources
