##Lesson 5, 9/20

##Goals
- Introduce and experiment with radical revision
- Understand revision as a critical component of the writing process
- Get feedback from peers on formal draft

##Schedule
- Go over radical revision handout (15 min)
- Apply radical revision strategies to formal drafts (20 min)
- Exchange formal drafts with peers ( min)

##Complex interpretive problems  (15 minutes)
- Pass out/adapt the "What is a problem?" worksheet. Do only page 2-4; read 2 out loud with them (not so different from tensions/ambiguities/contradictions - just an expansion of those categories). Ask them to read the examples on pages 3 and 4 and jot down which paragraphs have more sophisticated problems and why. Discuss briefly.

##Introduce radical revision (15 min)
- Read through this handout and mark radical revision strategies that you think you'd like to implement in this draft.
- Discuss together the strategies we found appealing.

##Apply revision to draft (20 min)
- Now take the next 20 minutes to apply one of the strategies to your formal draft. This might mean only working on one paragraph.

##Exchange papers (40 minutes)
- Now exchange your formal drafts with the person next to you (what to do if they've edited an entire paragraph already??)
- As you're reading your partner's draft, mark any sections that need more fleshing out (more evidence, stronger argument, better connection to rest of paper). Mark any sentences that are particularly bulky or confusing. But also mark sections that you think are particularly strong so that your partner can build off his/her strong suits as well.
