#Lesson Plan 5

##To Print
- Sample passages handout

##Goals
- Discuss why clear and communicative writing matters, and why style and grammar (though arbitrary) are important
- Establish the difference between reader and writer-based prose
- Further discuss audience (of this paper and in general)

##Schedule
- Intro (need to find a clip or something) (5 minutes)
- Discuss Orwell and why style matters (20 min)
- Discuss Flower and writer vs reader base prose (20 min)
- Style examples (15 minutes)
- Work with two formal paragraphs (15 minutes)

##Clip (5min)
- potential clips: something to do with empathy connected to/similar to grandin/animals (how grandin can think like an animal but not like other humans in some ways) - connecting this with writing (sacks has a quote about her writing, which often veers a bit of course); anyway connecting the challenge of thinking like animals to the challenge of thinking like your reader (not a perfect comparison obviously); or do some kind of linguistic clip about grammar to feed into the arbitrariness of grammar/style - an arbitrariness that is non-the-less important (??)

##Style Discussion (20 min)
- Now that you've started your formal draft, I'd like to take today to talk about writing style. So far we've mostly focused on close reading a text, developing a sophisticated argument, and laying down the larger essay structure. But it is also important to think about your writing on the sentence level. Though grammar might seem like an arbitrary construct and style might seem like a highly subjective judgment--and often you will find different professors have different stylistic preferences--developing style and clarity in your writing is essential in order to effectively communicate with your audience and further clarify your own argument. Trimming your language down to its essentials eliminates redundancies and rhetorical crutches, establishing your actual points and revealing weak spots in your argument. Today we're going to think about the significance of our writing styles and then work through some style strategies.
- Bring out the Orwell piece that you were assigned. Take a couple minutes to free write in response to Orwell, potentially answering the following questions:
  - What do you think of Orwell's claim that bad English produces bad thoughts?
  - Do you sympathize more with Orwell's linguistic conservatism or with those who argue that such undertakings are "archaic," as he puts it? Is there a possible in between?
  - What do you think of the connection Orwell makes between writing and politics?
  - Do you find any of his five criticisms useful? Have they made you rethink your own writing style?
- Come back together and discuss the Orwell/the importance of style

##Discuss Reader vs Writer Based Prose (20 min)
- Now let's turn the Flower reading. I want you to look through the Flower again and take a couple minutes to answer the following questions:
  - What are the key differences between reader and writer based prose?
  - What strategies can you implement in your own writing?
  - What do you imagine is difficult about writing reader-based prose?
- Come back together and discuss

##Go through sample passages (15 min)
- Make a handout (??) of some sample passages; identify reader vs writer based sentences; select a few bad sentences and rewrite them together on the board

##Work with two formal paragraphs
- Now let's work on the two formal paragraphs you wrote for homework. Take the last fifteen minutes to identify any of the 5 criticisms that Orwell presents; any instances of writer instead of reader based prose; any other style strategies that came up in discussion. Circle sentences you want to re-write or begin to rewrite them now.
- Your formal draft is due Wednesday and you'll be  revising one paragraph for Thursday's class. It's important to keep style and revising in mind throughout the formal draft process; reworking your wording _as_ you write your drafts means reworking your ideas and solidifying your arguments. We'll be discussing revising more on Thursday since revision is such a critical part of the writing process.
