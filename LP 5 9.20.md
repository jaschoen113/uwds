##Lesson 5, 9/20

##Print

- Little red schoolhouse (p 3-4)
- Radical revision handout
- Complex interpretive problem handout?

##Goals
- Develop test for rich interpretive problems
- Introduce and experiment with radical revision
- Understand revision as a critical component of the writing process
- Get feedback from peers on formal draft

##Schedule
- Complex interpretive problems (25 min)
- Radical revision handout (15 min)
- Apply radical revision strategies to exploratory drafts (35 min)

##Complex interpretive problems  (25 minutes)
- Now that we have been working on our exploratory drafts, it's a good time to go over interpretive problems again. How do you know when your interpretive problem is rich, nuanced, or complex enough? This is a difficult question, and not one with a simple litmus test. And this question will probably stick with you throughout all your writing in college and beyond. But I would like to compare some interpretive problems, and go over strategies for enriching our problems.
- Pass out Little Red Schoolhouse (p 3 -4): read through these two examples, and mark which one you think is a more complex problem. Why is that so? Talk to a partner about this (6 minutes) Share with class (5 minutes)
- Okay, here is another way to think about how to complicate problems [come up with examples for these]:  
  - Commonly understood problem --> better problem
  - Broad problem --> sub-problem
  - Traditional question --> new question
  - Universal problem -> relative (i.e. culturally specific) problem
  - Basic problem -> complex problem (breaks down basic problem into parts that might be paradoxical, dissonant, etc)
  - Unfeasible problem -> feasible problem
  - Existing method -> better method

##Introduce radical revision (15 min)
- Now that we have exploratory drafts and have started our formal drafts and outlines, I'd like to introduce the concept of radical revision. Radical revision can mean generating missing thinking on the page, rewriting whole sections of an essay from scratch, and/or sacrificing anything in the draft that isn't working. The point is to develop more complex ideas by keeping our writing provisional. You shouldn't be afraid to radically revise your essay at any stage; but now that we still haven't written an entire formal draft, it's especially easier to radically revise.  
- This handout gives you several approaches to radical revision. I want you to read through them and mark ones that you'd like to implement in this draft. The last half of class you'll be applying one of these strategies to draft, so start think about which ones you might use.
- Break into partners and discuss which ones you like (or don't like) and why.
- Anyone want to share with class? Any questions?

##Apply revision to writing project (35 min)
- Now take the next 20 minutes to apply one of the strategies to either your exploratory draft, your outline, or your one of your formal paragraphs. This might mean only working on one paragraph or idea for now.
