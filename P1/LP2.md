##Introduce P1 (15 minutes)
- Handout prompt and checklist
Things to emphasize:
- Main goal: create your own argument about the ideas and formal choices of the text
- Three subgoals:
1) present the text accurately and fairly to an audience that may be unfamiliar with it
2) Identify something specific about the textâ€™s ideas, evidence, and form that are worth examining more closely
3) Make a claim of your own about why your reading of this text that has some stakes attached.

##TMR essay (30 minutes)
- I asked you to identify the argument and moments of close reading; we'll start there and then we'll move on to some other items on the checklist
- Let's try to reconstruct how the argument develops:
  - What passage selected? Why is this a passage worth examining? What makes it special, what makes it complicate the text at large?
    - The question, "do monsters really exist?" It potentially undermines the larger argument, making it an exceptional and important part of the piece. She can read its form (as a question), she can also read its language (symptom, anxiety, etc).
  - How does the writer close read the passage? Look at specific moments of close reading
    - Looks at specific words like "surely" and "perhaps"; also looks at the form of the question ("Cohen demands a definite answer")
  - How does the writer connect the writing to the meaning of the passage? How does a close examination of form, word choice, rhetorical moves lead to a deeper understanding of the text?
    - Links confident language to playing with our egos (increasing our anxiety, something investigated in the theory), links language of anxiety to anxiety, links to indeterminacy of the question to anxiety
  - What is the main argument of this piece? Where is it?
    - The question is really testing reader's level of thought and whether they will give in easily to a certain argument because they are uneasy; this readerly anxiety parallels the anxiety of the monster; and this kind of anxiety reinforces unthought  
  - How does the writer introduce the larger project of "Monster Culture"? How much context does she give? How much does she use the rest of the text (parts that are not from her passage)?
    - Mostly in the second paragraph; lays out main project, primary investigation, even describes academic tone; gives enough information about his argument/tone so that the reader will understand argument later on (i.e. relationship between anxiety and monsters)
  - How might you describe this essay's structure?
    - introduction, context, passage, back-up/tone, close reading/building anticipation, close reading/proding ego, close reading/anxiety, lays out claim/connects close readings, conclusion/re-articulating claim/moving onto implications
  - How would you describe the tone and style of the piece?
    - mostly scholarly, occasionally dramatized
  - What kind of audience do you think this piece is directed towards? Who might be interested in this piece?
    - people who have read "monster culture", people who are interested in "anxious reading", people interested in rhetorical questions, people interested in how authors engage/affect their audiences  

## Annotation (5 minutes)

Ask them for how they annotated the TMR essay, ask them for any other annotation strategies they know of, particularly for reading essays instead of poetry (write those on board as well), then add to the board any they haven't yet come up with:
  - underline topic sentence in paragraph
  - put question marks in margin
  - put exclamations in margin
  - star critical lines or passages
  - write questions in margins
  - add your opinion or another author's opinions in margins
  - add an outline (1, 2, 3 or a, b, c etc) for when there are points in succession
  - draw arrows between ideas
  - summarize in margins  
  - circle words you don't know/need to look up
  - bracket important concepts/key terms/other sources or authors

## What makes an argument interesting (15 minutes)
- Take about 4 minutes to respond to this question: What makes an argument interesting? For inspiration, you might think about something you read or heard in the past week that made you go "oh that's very interesting!" You can write about that specific thing and then try to articulate why exactly it was interesting to you. Also, if it's easier for you, you might think about what makes an argument uninteresting? Maybe you've read something in the past week and thought, wow that was really dull -- try to articulate why it was uninteresting to you.
- Discuss and collect on board
- Propose Epstein's theory of the interesting (map on board):
  - Russian literary theorist at Emory
  - Theory is that the "interest of a theory is inversely proportional to the probability of its thesis, and directly proportional to the probability of its argument" interest = provability/probability
  - What this means is that something which is unexpected, which seems at first very unlikely, but then is ultimately proven or at least very convincingly argued for, is the most interesting
  - What is uninteresting is something that either obvious (very probable because we know it to be true already) or something that has no proof or evidence that it is true
  - Example: story of Jesus, which certainly has interested much of humanity for 2000 years -- it's very improbable that someone would rise from the dead, and at the same time various groups and authorities have produced evidence and arguments that have convinced people that it did in fact happen
  - Another example: theory of relativity -- it's seems very unlikely that a clock farther away from a massive body would run quicker than a clock closer to the body, and yet the math/clocks seems to prove that to be true
  - Another way to think about this is the term "interest" at the root of the word "interesting"--in economic terms, you receive a higher interest when you invest in something that is less likely to happen, but you only get that interest if it actually happens
- Reiterate that the goal of this class, in every progression, will be to make interesting arguments; interesting arguments are not arguments that simply set out to prove or disprove another's argument - in other words, they are not evaluative; rather, interesting arguments develop new ideas, often building off or responding to the ideas of others -- in other words, they are analytical
- This doesn't mean you have to agree with everything that your chosen text or source says; but it means that you should be attempting to illuminate something new about that text, or using that text to somehow complicate your own ideas
