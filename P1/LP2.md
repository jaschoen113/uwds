##Introduce P1 (15 minutes)
- Handout prompt and checklist
Things to emphasize:
- Main goal: create your own argument about the ideas and formal choices of the text
- Three subgoals:
1) present the text accurately and fairly to an audience that may be unfamiliar with it
2) Identify something specific about the textâ€™s ideas, evidence, and form that are worth examining more closely
3) Make a claim of your own about why your reading of this text that has some stakes attached.

##TMR essay (30 minutes)
- I asked you to identify the argument and moments of close reading; we'll start there and then we'll move on to some other items on the checklist
- What is the main argument of this piece? Where is it?
- Let's try to reconstruct how the argument develops:
  - What passage selected? Why is this a passage worth examining? What makes it special, what makes it complicate the text at large?
  - How does the writer close read the passage? Look at specific moments of close reading
  - How does the writer connect the writing to the meaning of the passage? How does a close examination of form, word choice, rhetorical moves lead to a deeper understanding of the text?
  - How might you describe this essay's structure? Map paragraphs on board

## Annotation (5 minutes)

Ask them for how they annotated the TMR essay, ask them for any other annotation strategies they know of, particularly for reading essays instead of poetry (write those on board as well), then add to the board any they haven't yet come up with:
  - underline topic sentence in paragraph
  - put question marks in margin
  - put exclamations in margin
  - star critical lines or passages
  - write questions in margins
  - add your opinion or another author's opinions in margins
  - add an outline (1, 2, 3 or a, b, c etc) for when there are points in succession
  - draw arrows between ideas
  - summarize in margins  
  - circle words you don't know/need to look up
  - bracket important concepts/key terms/other sources or authors

## What makes an argument interesting (15 minutes)
- Take about 4 minutes to respond to this question: What makes an argument interesting? What makes an argument uninteresting?
- Discuss and collect on board
- Propose Epstein's theory of the interesting (map on board)
- Reiterate that the goal of this class, in every progression, will be to make interesting arguments; interesting arguments are not arguments that simply set out to prove or disprove another's argument - in other words, they are not evaluative; rather, interesting arguments develop new ideas, often building off or responding to the ideas of others -- in other words, they are analytical
- This doesn't mean you have to agree with everything that your chosen text or source says; but it means that you should be attempting to illuminate something new about that text, or using that text to somehow complicate your own ideas
