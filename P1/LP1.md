##Free-write walk-in

1) What do you find most difficult about writing? And/or what do you want to improve most about your writing in college?


##Ice Breaker (10 mins)
- Since this is a seminar much of our class will be discussion-based, and we will also be reading each other's writing and constantly engaging with each other's ideas. So it is important that we get to know each other.
- Play name-game (ask if their names have any story attached to them, if not it's fine) - make everyone say the name that came before (then I'll try)


##Back to free-writing exercise

We're going to be doing a lot of free-writing like this in class. The goal here is to really "word vomit." Don't go for polished writing - just write whatever comes to your mind. I'll never cold call on you to read out what you've written. This exercise serves mainly as a springboard for our discussions.

(8 minutes)

Does anyone want to share anything they've come up with? (repeat questions); if no one volunteers, say something I want to work on with my own writing to open things up (i.e. revise my drafts more boldly/kill my darlings)

Some possible goals to bring up:

1. Write essays that an audience would want to read based on the strength and originality of their ideas, Accurate and insightful work with sources, and formal coherence (even beauty)
2. Anticipate and fulfill expectations of readers of your essays
3. Read actively, annotate source material, and take notes that will help you at later stages of writing
4. Present, analyze, reflect on sources and cite them
5. Adopt a problem- and inquiry-based approach to finding a project of your own
6. Propose, assess, and revise an academic writing project
7. Generate your own ideas in relationship to source materials that you encounter
8. Choose from common formal structures at the sentence, paragraph, and section levels and invent new ones
9. Provide, receive, and incorporate the responses of other writers to your work
10. Radically revise your drafts, postponing the moment at which your work on an essay is complete
11. Proofread and refine the most public versions of your work
12. Reflect on your own preferences and habits as a reader, writer, speaker, and thinker in order to sustain and enhance those that are helpful to you and to change or eliminate those that are blocking your development
13. Adopt multiple roles in a seminar setting to enrich discussion, support the intellectual community of a class, and listen with purpose


##Syllabus Overview  (30 minutes)
- Read through syllabus with themÂ 

- Google site and google drive (sign up sheet with personal gmails); if you do not have personal gmail or do not feel comfortable using your personal gmail, then i will make a generic gmail that the entire class can use

- Presentation and workshop sign up live now. Read through both of these assignments to understand what is expected of you. All course readings are also already up if you want to take a look at them. Note that for workshops, you're either going to work ahead or have only a few days to implement changes.

##Annotation & Close Reading Exercise (30 minutes)

- Now we're going to begin working on our writing. To write well, first we have to make sure we're reading well.

- While you'll be close reading primarily academic essays in your own writing this semester, I want to start off with a poem. Poems tend to be particularly rich for close reading because of their interesting language, dynamic forms, and vibrant images. But you can apply this same practice to any form of writing, art, or media.

Poem: Constance Naden, Nebular Theory

About Constance Naden: English poet, lectured on philosophy and science, born 1858. Interested in Herbert Spencer's philosophy that maps evolution onto social science (society as organism that evolves through natural selection). Because of her dual interests in poetry and science, she makes for a compelling first voice for our class to discuss

1. First, let's read the poem out loud, and I just want you to think about what the poem is saying on its most basic level. If you were to summarize the poem for a 7 year old, what would you say? Feel free to annotate as we read, marking anything you find particularly important for this task. (Have someone read it out loud and come up with a basic summary, write on board)

2. Now let's read it again. This time, I want you to read it alone, and I want you to annotate it as you go, especially if you didn't the first time. As you read, I also want you to look for anything you find particularly striking. Is there an unexpected word or phrase? A contradictory image? An ambiguous meaning in one line? A tension between a formal element (a rhyme, the line-breaks, etc) and the meaning we've discussed? Anything unnerving? illogical? strange? Is it playing with form or convention in some way? (Read through it again, jot down some ideas on board)

3. Now that we have our summary and our observation on the board, can we make any more solid links between the primary meaning of the poem and one of our observations? In other words, can we connect any of these observations to the larger "point" of the passage? Do any of these observations change/reinforce/complicate our understanding of the larger text? Given this particular observation, can you say anything more nuanced, complicated, or interesting about the entire poem itself, or a possible reading of the poem? Does the "simple" meaning of the poem become more complex when we pay close attention to the language? This will be our **claim** (write on board in third column). If they are not answering quickly, give them a minute to jot a potential claim down.

##Example questions

Context: Constance Naden was a follower of Herbert Spencer, who believed that we can describe society in scientific, evolutionary terms. Do we see that belief system at play in this poem?
Content: The poem suggests that there is a more scientific narrative of creation than we are used to. But is this still ultimately a story? That is, does this poem really explain the science behind creation? What does it mean to explain that science?
Form: I notice a lot of alliteration, particularly in the middle of the poem. How does that alliteration intensify or even mimic the subject matter?

##Thursday Assignment
- For Thursday, you have an assigned reading. Print, read, and annotate it. Also, try to find one moment in the text that interests you(it could be a sentence, a paragraph, or a structural observation) and chart out the "summary, observation, claim" -- try your best at this, and we'll discuss them in class
- Read through the entire syllabus, the reading and writing day assignments
- Sign up for presentation and workshop and Doodle Office Hours
