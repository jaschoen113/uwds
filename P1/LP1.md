- Discuss active reading and annotation techniques
- Introduce close reading skills

##Brief Introduction (5 mins)
- Introduce myself
- Welcome to University Writing - a class designed to introduce undergrads to academic writing and develop fundamental writing skills. Our section is specifically Data Sciences and Engineering themed, meaning that we will be reading texts that feed into academic debates specifically concerning the science and engineering community, but also, as you will see, asking more universal questions. I'm going to go over the goals of this class and what our themed section means in a couple minutes. But first I want us to start getting to know each other.

##Ice Breaker (10 mins)
- Since this is a seminar much of our class will be discussion-based, and we will also be reading each other's writing and constantly engaging with each other's ideas. So it is important that we get to know each other.
- Play name-game (ask if their names have any story attached to them, if not it's fine) - make everyone say the name that came before (then I'll try)

##Course Goals (15 minutes)

(3 minutes)

- Okay now, I want us to start thinking about the the goals of this course.
- We will be learning how to write academic papers. Since academic writing can greatly vary across disciplines, this class will not prepare you for a specific kind of academic writing. Rather, we will be developing fundamental skills that you can carry across disciplines. Since we are focused on academic writing, our assumed audience will be smart academic readers--in other words, your peers in this room, in your other classes, and in your future academic environments.
- Since this class is themed "Data Sciences and Engineering", all of our reading will be engaging with academic conversations around data sciences and engineering. This means that your essays - which will be working with our readings - will be engaging with those conversations. So we can think of the theme as a kind of inspiration for our writing, though the primary goal of this class is to work on writing itself. This class does not presume any knowledge of science or engineering, or any intention of majoring in science or engineering. I myself am studying medieval English literature, so my specialty pretty far removed from modern technology. But I am still very interested in these present technological debates, as I hope you will be as you read our primary texts. To me, the most important part of the writing process is selecting a topic that interests you, and finding that interest even in conversations that you might never have considered interesting before. So, even if you have no explicit interest in data science or engineering, I am confident you will find something interesting in our readings and discussions to passionately write about in your essays.

(5 minutes)

Now, what are our specific writing goals for this class?

I want us to take a couple minutes to reflect on our writing. Please get a sheet of paper to write on, and for the next couple minutes I want you to write a response to one or two or all of these questions:

1) What do you find most difficult about writing?
2) Has anyone ever told you something about your writing that you agree you need to work on?
3) What are you worried about in transitioning your writing from high school level to undergraduate level?

We're going to be doing a lot of free-writing like this in class. The goal here is to really "word vomit." Don't go for polished writing - just write whatever comes to your mind. I'll never cold call on you to read out what you've written. This exercise serves mainly as a springboard for our discussions.

(8 minutes)

Does anyone want to share anything they've come up with? (repeat questions); if no one volunteers, say something I want to work on with my own writing to open things up (i.e. revise my drafts more boldly/kill my darlings)

Some possible goals to bring up:

1. Write essays that an audience would want to read based on the strength and originality of their ideas, Accurate and insightful work with sources, and formal coherence (even beauty)
2. Anticipate and fulfill expectations of readers of your essays
3. Read actively, annotate source material, and take notes that will help you at later stages of writing
4. Present, analyze, reflect on sources and cite them
5. Adopt a problem- and inquiry-based approach to finding a project of your own
6. Propose, assess, and revise an academic writing project
7. Generate your own ideas in relationship to source materials that you encounter
8. Choose from common formal structures at the sentence, paragraph, and section levels and invent new ones
9. Provide, receive, and incorporate the responses of other writers to your work
10. Radically revise your drafts, postponing the moment at which your work on an essay is complete
11. Proofread and refine the most public versions of your work
12. Reflect on your own preferences and habits as a reader, writer, speaker, and thinker in order to sustain and enhance those that are helpful to you and to change or eliminate those that are blocking your development
13. Adopt multiple roles in a seminar setting to enrich discussion, support the intellectual community of a class, and listen with purpose

##Syllabus Overview (15 min)
- Read through syllabus with themÂ 

- We will be reading 14 essays this semester. In progression one, one of these essays will be the topic of your essay, and in progression 2, two of these essays will be prominent voices in your essay. But throughout the rest of class, these essays will be critical models that we examine to discuss writing style, form, and technique. All of the essays deal with science and technology in some way (some more explicitly than others), and all add to critical conversations surrounding what it means to be a human and how science and technology complicates that definition. Some essays are meant for popular audiences, others were published in academic journals. Some are narrative-heavy, some are research-heavy. All of them will provide us with rich intellectual problems to consider and various writing techniques to model.  

- To help us navigate each of the 14 essays, you each will give one presentation (hand out presentation assignment)

- The other central component of this course is the workshops (hand out workshop assignment)

- Google site and google drive (sign up sheet with personal gmails); if you do not have personal gmail or do not feel comfortable using your personal gmail, then i will make a generic gmail that the entire class can use

- I will send out the presentation and workshop sign-ups at 5pm today. Read through both of these assignments to understand what is expected of you. All course readings are also already up if you want to take a look at them. Note that for workshops, you're either going to work ahead or have only a few days to implement changes.

##Annotation & Close Reading Exercise (30 minutes)

- Now we're going to begin working on our writing. To write well, first we have to make sure we're reading well.

- While you'll be close reading primarily academic essays in your own writing this semester, I want to start off with a poem. Poems tend to be particularly rich for close reading because of their interesting language, dynamic forms, and vibrant images. But you can apply this same practice to any form of writing, art, or media.

Poem: Constance Naden, Nebular Theory

1. First, let's read the poem out loud, and I just want you to think about what the poem is saying on its most basic level. If you were to summarize the poem for a 7 year old, what would you say? Feel free to annotate as we read, marking anything you find particularly important for this task. (Have someone read it out loud and come up with a basic summary, write on board)

2. Now let's read it again. This time, I want you to read it alone, and I want you to annotate it as you go, especially if you didn't the first time. As you read, I also want you to look for anything you find particularly striking. Is there an unexpected word or phrase? A contradictory image? An ambiguous meaning in one line? A tension between a formal element (a rhyme, the line-breaks, etc) and the meaning we've discussed? Anything unnerving? illogical? strange? Is it playing with form or convention in some way? (Read through it again, jot down some ideas on board)

3. Now that we have our summary and our observation on the board, can we make any more solid links between the primary meaning of the poem and one of our observations? In other words, can we connect any of these observations to the larger "point" of the passage? Do any of these observations change/reinforce/complicate our understanding of the larger text? Given this particular observation, can you say anything more nuanced, complicated, or interesting about the entire poem itself, or a possible reading of the poem? This will be our **claim** (write on board in third column). If they are not answering quickly, give them a minute to jot a potential claim down.


##TMR Essay
- For Thursday, you do not have an assigned response to write. But you do have an assigned reading. You'll be reading a TMR essay for P1. For every progression, we'll start with a TMR essay to see right away what the final product we're aiming for might look like. These essays serve as potential models, but are by no means the only way you can write your P1 paper. I encourage you to read other TMR essays (you can find them organized by progression) http://morningsidereview.org/assignment/critical-response/
- For Thursday, print out, read, and annotate the TMR article. Identify (on the essay) the main argument or thesis (star), and also note moments of close reading.
