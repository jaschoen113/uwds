#Lesson Plan 6, 9/22
- Workshops (30 min each)
- Exploratory to formal draft

##Transition from exploratory draft to formal draft (15 minutes)
- Hand out formal draft prompt and read through it with them
- Hand out exercise three and go over outline assignment and 2 formal paragraphs
- Remember that an outline should be brief/doesn't need to be complete sentences; might want to start just jotting down potential points and then shift them around; if you could imagine proving your claim in a couple different ways, you can sketch up the possibilities and see what would be stronger
- When writing formal paragraphs, you should remember that each paragraph should serve as a semi-autonomous unit but also clearly indicate its place within the larger essay. Each paragraph should have a mini thesis. In high school you were probably asked to write a topic sentence in the beginning of each paragraph that asserts the paragraph's purpose and relation to the rest of the essay. You don't need to have such a strict structure now - often academic articles do not have explicit "topic sentences" for every paragraph. However, it is still useful to write a topic sentence for each paragraph, identifying the paragraph's argument and relation to the rest of the paper, even if you do not end up putting that sentence in a formal draft.
