##P1 Exploratory Draft Peer Review

Due Friday 9/16
Via Google Docs (your peer's P1 project file)

In the margins, identify the following:
  - A potential interpretive problem (if the writer seems to have several interpretive problems, identify which one you think he/she is currently gravitating towards)
  - A potential claim deriving from an interpretive problem (again, if there are several claims, try to identify the primary claim you see emerging)
  - Ideas that intrigue you and you are curious to see expanded
  - Ideas that you do not see connecting to the main interpretive problem/primary claim

In a comment below the draft, you might respond to the following questions:
  - Does his/her interpretive problem stem from an incontestable observation?
  - Can you identify what type of interpretive problem it is?
  - Do you think the problem can be even further complicated? If so, what further questions would you like him/her to answer?
  - Does a claim follow logically from the interpretive problem?
  - Does the claim relate the specific problem to the larger text?
  - What kind of further evidence do you need to accept the writer's claim?
  - If there are strands of disparate thought, do you see a potential connection between them? Or are they working towards different problems/claims?   

- Remember these are **exploratory drafts** that you are reviewing. Do not focus on grammar, spelling, etc. Instead try to identify **productive lines of thought** that you see developing in your peer's writing that might be further expanded in a formal draft.
- Try as best you can to **dramatize the presence of a reader**. Describe what you understand the writer to be communicating and how you are following or not following his/her ideas.
