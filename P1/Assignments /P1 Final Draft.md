1200-1500 words

After you receive feedback on your draft, revise it into a final essay:  

- Use the strategies we discuss in class and the comments you received to refine and clarify your ideas, organization, evidence, and sentences.
- Frequently, academic writers find that their claims appear in the final pages of their early drafts, but that their projects become more coherent to the reader when they move them to the first page in their final drafts. Other projects work best when the problem is identified on the first page and the claim emerges from the work the writer performs in the essay. Ask yourself, what will motivate my reader to keep reading: discovering how I can support my interesting claim, or following me as I seek to crack an intellectual problem?
