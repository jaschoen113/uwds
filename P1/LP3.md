#Class Three Lesson Plan, Tuesday 1/24

##Schedule
- Turing presentation and discussion (35 minutes)
- Develop close reading (20 mins)
- Introduce exploratory draft (5 minutes)
- Play chatterbot (10 mins)

##Turing Presentation and Discussion (30-35 minutes)
- Other questions:
  - Why do you think Turing uses this particular game as a test? What does this particular game say about Turing's understanding of humanity?
  - Why is a hypothetical test (one which certainly hadn't been passed in his time, let alone ours) useful to Turing's point? Why might that be more or less effective than Turing just coming out and saying that he thinks machines might be able to think?
  - How does Turing limit the scope of his argument? Why are the limitations/definitions he sets up important for his purpose?
  - What do you make of Turing's initial question, and sudden refusal of that question? Why might he bring up that question and then refuse it? What is left in our minds as a result?
  - How does Turing use counter-argument to structure his paper? Are all of his responses satisfying? Why does he give different variety and length of response?

##Close Readings of Turing (20 mins)
- Let's choose one specific passage to close read. Does anyone want to volunteer a passage they've selected, or a passage from our discussion? Should be about 3-4 sentences long.
- First let's establish meaning; what is Turing saying in this passage?  
- Now let's exhaust the text - word choice, form, rhetorical strategies, etc
- Now let's try to formulate claim(s); do any of these observations relate to the meaning of the passage here? Is there any connection between language and meaning?
- What about the larger meaning of the entire essay?

##Chatterbot
- Play with any of these bots (on the extras tab)
- What kinds of questions did you ask?
- What kinds of responses did you get?
- Why do you think certain questions are more difficult than others?
