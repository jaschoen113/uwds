#Lesson Plan 6, 9/22
- Workshops (30 min each)
- Exploratory to formal draft

#Admin

- Formal draft prompt is up under "Draft Prompts." It's due Tuesday. It should be about 900 words. It's essentially just moving from your exploratory draft to a formalized, structured essay. There are some helpful guidelines on the prompt that you should read first. We're not going to read through the prompt because it's pretty straight-forward and reiterates a lot of things we've talked about already, but you should read that first.
- You'll put your formal draft in the SAME FILE as your exploratory draft. Some people have PDFs up -- make sure you replace that with an actual google doc. This is necessary because we'll be doing peer reviews in those google docs. The title of that doc should be "Last Name P1 Drafts"
- I'm allowing laptops during the workshop discussion so you can access the shared google docs. If people are doing other things on their laptops today then we're gonna switch to paper, which is more time and effort for you guys.

##Workshops

- Each student is going to have 30 minutes.
- They'll have 5 minutes to introduce their draft, talk about what stage of the writing process they're at, what they're struggling with, etc.
- Then I'm going to ask them to give a very quick summary of each paragraph, so we understand how they are thinking about the progression of their argument, even if we are not seeing that totally come through on the page yet.
- Then I'm going to open the class up to discussion for about 20 minutes. I'm going to try to step back as much as possible. So I'm not going to have people raise their hands to talk, because I really want you guys to be leading the conversation. Here are two rules for the workshop:
  1. Except for the first person to speak, when you speak, you should address the person who spoke before you. You should have something to say that relates to the previous point. We don't want to be flipping back and forth between the essay.
  2. If you want to change topics, you should have a reason for it (it seems like the current conversation has been exhausted). That's fine, and this will happen often (we're not going to talk about one paragraph the whole time). But I don't want is everyone just bringing up their pre-prepared specific point, without logical structure to the conversation.
- If we abide by these rules, then I won't really have to talk at all.


## Takeaways
- Check on argument: are you looking at something specific about the language or form of the passage throughout the entire essay?
- Check on argument: are you claiming that your observation is particularly interesting considering the text itself? not just: there is a rhetorical question that destabilizes or confuses the reader (you might say that about any rhetorical question... it is a question). instead: it destabilizes the reader and that plays into the author's argument ABOUT instability -- can you copy paste your claim onto any paper?
- Check on close readings: are you really looking at the language and form on a microscopic as well as macroscopic level?
