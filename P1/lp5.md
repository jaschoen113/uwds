##Lesson 5 Tuesday 1/31

##Schedule
- Martin Discussion and Presentation (35 min)
- Discuss Martin as model essay (20 min)
- Writing Response/peer feedback discussion (10 minutes)

##Free-write
- Freewrite: think about a good and a bad experience getting your work reviewed. what made experience good or bad? discuss and list answers on the board

##Discussion about Writing Responses (15 min)
- Discussion, as a writer, what do you need from your reviewers? Discuss and list on board
- Now that we've started to think about this, I want to present to you a strategy for peer reviews, which we will use throughout this course. This is called **dramatizing the presence of a reader**. What does this mean? Whenever you are reading a draft, 1) narrate your experience as a reader. This is more difficult than simply marking an idea as good or bad. Try to explain to the writer your reading experience.

Example of evaluator comment:

"This is a weak argument"

Example of editorial comment:

"This is an awkward sentence"

Example of readerly comment:

"As I read this paragraph, I understand that your trying to argue x. However, I'm having trouble understanding how y connects x."

"As I read this paragraph, I can tell that you are developing x idea. I don't see yet why x is important for me to understand."

So perhaps your first impulse as a commentator is to simply write, "this argument is weak." But by narrating your readerly experience - that is, articulating what is exactly you _do_ understand about the writer's argument - and then considering why you as a reader you need that argument expanded, justified, etc., you allow the writer to understand your experience as a reader and understand how his argument might not be as complicated as he thought. We should try to make our comments as objective as possible, not only because this avoids hurt feelings etc, but because in being objective commentators we force ourselves to be specific and more helpful commentators. Reading, of course, is never entirely objective; you're still a subjective reader on some level. But by attempting to communicate your personal reading experience as clearly as possible, you allow the writer to understand a reader's experience of his work and ultimately better improve his own writing.

2) Focus on areas that the writer wants feedback on. 4) Make response appropriate to stage of writing process. For exploratory draft, we're just looking to help the writer discover the potential of initial ideas that are on the page. Don't focus on sentence-level editing.

##Formal draft overview 

##Martin Presentation and Discussion (35 min)
-  What effect might the use of the active or passive voice have in scientific research that describes gendered processes or behaviors?
- The article begins with a quotation from James Hillman’s The Myth of Analysis. What is the significance of the quotation in the context of the article?
- What is “‘atomism’”? What does the article suggest is wrong with an atomistic approach?
- How does Martin co-opt the terms of these textbooks or introduce her own? What is the effect of each of these approaches? Does she model a neutral, non-personified way of describing the egg and sperm?
- What might be the benefit of personifying the egg and sperm? Is it worth the implications she describes?

##Martin as Model (20 min)

Sketch out summary/observation/claim for Martin, but from her perspective. If you were Martin what is your summary/observation/claim about biology texts?

- Martin serves as a particularly useful model for our own essays, since she engages in close reading; for this reason, I thought we could read Martin like we did the TMR article
- What is her claim? Is it debatable? Is it original? Is it evaluative or analytical?
    - Note that though it is _critical_ it is not evaluative; it does not simply say that the biology textbooks are "weak" or "illogical;" it also doesn't use this rhetorical problem to take down the larger point of the biology textbooks (it's not claiming their science is faulty as a result); it is critical but also analytical -- it looks at the various parts of these texts, and builds its own original claim around those parts; it constructs a new argument   
- How does she support her claim? How does she perform close readings? How much of the text does she need to quote? How much context does she provide? Ask the class for the passage they chose
    - Note that she uses various amounts of text when necessary. But usually when she includes a larger quote, she returns to that quote from a microscopic level -- she then points the reader to the specific language she's looking at within that quote
    - Nearly every paragraph has evidence in it, mostly in the form of quotes
- How does she structure this essay? [OUT]
    1. Introduction (states observation, claim, motive)
    2. Menstruation as waste vs male reproduction as remarkable
    3. Female organs as old and degenerating, why not male as wasteful also?
    4. Active description of male organs vs passive description of female organs
    5. Narrative of romance/religion/myth as a result -- men look powerful, women look weak
    6. New research, old stereotypes (various examples of how research tries to conform research narrative to existing narrative)
    7. These narratives also get at another stereotype -- female devouring spider
    8. Another potential model would be cybernetic, tho that also has drawbacks
    9. This creates a mirror effect that spits back scientific basis for cultural stereotypes
    10. Implications: if we shake these metaphors, we might better investigate nature, and rob them of their power to naturalize social conventions
- **Motive** = her reason for writing the essay
- What is her motive? How does she make the clear for the readers? Why should we keep **reading** her argument?
    - "Part if my goal..." note that it is specific (not some general motive about gender or biology, but their intersection), but also shows that it is a specific problem worth investigating
- **Implications** = what is the larger takeaway of her argument or what might happen if we believe her argyment  
- What are the implications of her argument? What might happen if we **believe** her argument?
    - We would be able to do better science and shake these stereotypes
- How does she transition between ideas on the sentence level? On the paragraph level?
