##Schedule
- Jamison Presentation and Discussion (35 min)
- Jamison close reading (20 min)
- Explain exploratory draft

##Jamison Presentation and Discussion (35 min)
- Additional questions:  
- Where are moments of ethos, pathos, logos in this piece?
- Can we think about these rhetorical moves in relation to her larger exploration of empathy?
- How does she use pronouns to play with the idea of empathy?
- What is the effect of the script structure? 
- What are some recurring images in this text? 
- Why might she hold the heart surgery off from us? Does that feel reconciled? Is there a protectiveness there, as she describes? 

##Motif Close Reading (20 min)
- Like the Turing exercise we did last class, let's select one pattern.
- First let's identify the pattern; what is the meaning of the pattern? let's identify the various points it occurs
- Then let's try to exhaust observations of this pattern: Does the pattern change over time, does it stay the same? What is the effect of the pattern? What kind of images, words, structure is at play throughout the pattern?
- Now let's try to move to a claim; can we couple any of these observations with a larger idea at play in the essay? Do any of these observations bring us to reading the text differently than before we had closely examined the pattern in detail?

##Explain exploratory draft (10 minutes)
- Point is to really explore ideas through writing
