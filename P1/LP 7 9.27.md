LP 7 Tuesday 2/7

Overview:

- Discuss Hofstadter (35 min)
- Revision lesson (20 min)
- Poem close reading (15 minutes)

##Presentation and Discussion of Hofstadter (35 min)
- Additional questions:
  - How does Hofstadter use key terms to develop his claim?
  - What are the advantages/disadvantages of creating a term like sphexishness?
  - How does he use exempla to develop his claim?
  - What do you make of the link between writing and mechanization?
- Look at line about rewriting as transition to revision

##Discuss revision (15 min)
- In general, I think there are two ways of thinking about revision: macro and micro
- Macro revision involves taking out entire paragraphs, adding entire paragraphs, redoing entire paragraphs reshuffling the order of paragraphs, changing your claim, moving your claim from the intro to the end of the essay, etc
- Micro revision involves sentence level revision, moving around the order of some sentences in a paragraph, explaining a concept with one or two extra sentences, etc
- Both are important elements of revision, and can never be fully separated; we are almost always writing micro revisions when we write, since the particular language and logic of an individual sentence might be essential for the claim of the entire paper
- But at the same time, too often we settle for micro revisions instead of the harder, more time-consuming macro revision; and it's important to keep in mind that at any stage of a draft, a macro revision might be necessary, and fixing the micro problems might never fully fix underlying structural and logical flaws
- First I want to take a moment to brainstorm our current revisory practices, then I want to introduce some more
- Collect current revisory practices on board (you can do it regularly, have done it once, or just heard about it)
- Then add some more of my own
    - Write topic sentence for each paragraph and write it in an outline (reverse engineer); better yet, write them out on flashcards; shuffle them around
    - Make a copy of the essay in which you black out all the quotes; read through the essay without the quotes, see if you can tell that a quote should be there (if it reads normally, there is a problem); make sure you're properly introducing and engaging with each quote
    - Completely rewrite the introduction or conclusion, especially if you've developed a different claim, tone, or structure since previous drafts
    - Read the essay out loud
    - Find any sentences that are longer than 3 lines; consider whether you can break the sentence up with a period or semi-colon; circle all the prepositions and long-phrases (of, in, for) and see if you can take them out; circle any use of passive voice and see if you can rewrite it in active

## Poem Close Reading (15 minutes)
- What's the general meaning of this poem?
- Try to find one moment (a line, an image, a word, a rhyme) you find particularly striking, and see if you can connect it to the larger meaning of the poem
