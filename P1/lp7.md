LP 7 Tuesday 2/7

Overview:

- Discuss Hofstadter (35 min)
- Revision lesson (20 min)
- Poem close reading (15 minutes)

##Admin
- Good job finishing formal draft. Peer review of your peer's formal draft is due Friday (by 11:59 pm) - prompt is under Draft Prompts, where I have some more tips. At least one marginal comment per page, and an end-comment.
- On Thursday we're starting P2, though half the class will be a P1 Workshop. So for Tuesday have a Writing Response due, and you also need to print, read, annotate TMR essay.
- For today's conversation I'm putting back up the rules from Thursday, 1) react to the person before you (added: say their name) 2) change topics when there is a reason. Again, this isn't intended to quiet conversation but just to keep it coherent, and it's perfectly fine to change topics, just make sure first that no one else wants to say anything on the current topic. I'm going to try to step back more today, but I would like everyone to try to talk, which requires people who talk a lot to step back sometimes as well.

##Presentation and Discussion of Hofstadter (35 min)
- Additional questions:
  - How does Hofstadter use key terms to develop his claim?
  - What are the advantages/disadvantages of creating a term like sphexishness?
  - How does he use exempla to develop his claim?
  - What do you think about Hofstadter main premise that creativity is already mechanical? Can you think of any examples that would support his claim, or any that would negate it?
  - What do you think about the potential for machines to be creative? Would such creativity be like or unlike our own creativity? What might it look like?
  - What do you make of the link between writing and mechanization?
- Look at line about rewriting as transition to revision

##Discuss revision (15 min)
- Hofstadter is useful for thinking about our own writing in several ways. His argument about antisphexishness might be a potential check on our theses: does your thesis seem like it's been written a thousand times (i.e. the author evokes our sympathy to convince the reader of her argument) or does your thesis seem more new and original (i.e. the author's use of sympathy conflicts with her idea that empathy is impossible)?
- We can also think about what Hofstadter says about revision: you'll remember on page 528 he takes us through a revision of one of his sentences about concepts; the revisory process for Hofstadter reinforces his argument about concepts--just as memory is formed by connections between concepts, so he needs to make sure his reader can make all the connections that needs him to. This means writing out certain connections that he has taken for granted. This is a nice meta-moment for his argument, but I think it also shows a slice of the writing/revisory process that is usually kept hidden (for good reason, we don't have time to read every draft); but because we're always reading polished products, it's easy for us to assume that writing should be so quick and simple, when any good writer would definitely disagree; in a sense, when are writing, our revisions serve as omegas/self-watchers that make sure we're not repeating ourselves, but also make sure we're not doing a whole bunch of other things -- but to really revise well, we need to try to watch ourselves from as far as possible, to imagine the perspective of a reader
- In general, I think there are two ways of thinking about revision: macro and micro
- Macro revision involves taking out entire paragraphs, adding entire paragraphs, redoing entire paragraphs reshuffling the order of paragraphs, changing your claim, moving your claim from the intro to the end of the essay, etc
- Micro revision involves sentence level revision, moving around the order of some sentences in a paragraph, explaining a concept with one or two extra sentences, etc
- Both are important elements of revision, and can never be fully separated; we are almost always writing micro revisions when we write, since the particular language and logic of an individual sentence might be essential for the claim of the entire paper
- But at the same time, too often we settle for micro revisions instead of the harder, more time-consuming macro revision; and it's important to keep in mind that at any stage of a draft, a macro revision might be necessary, and fixing the micro problems might never fully fix underlying structural and logical flaws; one of the reasons we write several drafts of each progression essay, and get at least two types of feedback, is because we're practicing revision; the students who do best in this class are those that are not afraid to almost completely an essay after a formal draft; the ones who struggle are those who tweak and add a few sentences but don't do any large scale revision
- First I want to take a moment to brainstorm our current revisory practices, then I want to introduce some more
- Collect current revisory practices on board (you can do it regularly, have done it once, or just heard about it)
- Then add some more of my own
    - Write topic sentence for each paragraph and write it in an outline (reverse engineer); better yet, write them out on flashcards; shuffle them around
    - Make a copy of the essay in which you black out all the quotes; read through the essay without the quotes, see if you can tell that a quote should be there (if it reads normally, there is a problem); make sure you're properly introducing and engaging with each quote
    - Completely rewrite the introduction or conclusion, especially if you've developed a different claim, tone, or structure since previous drafts; write this out by hand
    - Read the essay out loud
    - Print off copy and edit with pen and pencil; take a couple hours and then edit; really try to read the essay as if it's someone else's, and you're encountering all these ideas for the first time: what assumptions is the writer maker? what further context and explanation do you need? what sentences are unclear?
    - Find any sentences that are longer than 3 lines; consider whether you can break the sentence up with a period or semi-colon; circle all the prepositions and long-phrases (of, in, for) and see if you can take them out; circle any use of passive voice and see if you can rewrite it in active


##Revise sentence

Central to our understanding of the nature of the relationships which exist between human
beings in Daniel Defoe’s eighteenth century novel Robinson Crusoe is a careful consideration
of the passage in which the print of a human foot is seen by Crusoe on the shore.

1. Circle the prepositions (of, in, about, for, onto, into)

Okay, the first step is easy - we just circle the prepositions. Do that now. Have someone do this on board.

Circle: of, between, in, of, in which, of, by, on

2. Draw a box around the “is” verb forms

The second step is also pretty easy, just draw a box around any “is” verb form. Do that now. Have someone do this on board.

Square: is, is

3. Ask, "Where's the action?” and underline it

Alright this step is a bit trickier. Now we ask - where’s the action? This means we need to think about what the central action of the sentence is, even if that action is not currently in verb form. So why don’t you guys look over this sentence and think about its main action. As a hint, I’ll say there are arguably two main actions in this sentence. Any ideas?  

This sentence has two things going on: 1) crusoe sees a human foot on the shore, 2) that passage helps us understand the relationships in the novel.

Underline: “is seen by” and “central to our understanding”

4. Change the "action" into a simple verb

Okay, now we’re going to change those actions to active verbs. Try that now for both those primary actions. Have someone come up and write new verb form.

change: “is seen by” to “sees”
change: “central to our understanding: to “we better understand ”

5. Move the doer into the subject (Who's kicking whom)

Okay, this step is a bit tricky again. We need to identify the doer of that primary action, and make that doer the subject. Let’s squiggle underline the doer. Now let’s move her ahead of the action verb.

squiggle “crusoe” - move in front of “sees”
I’ve kind of skipped forward here, because “better understand” already has “we” - one might also argue that “a careful consideration” is a subject (it’s what helping us understand better) but I think actually it’s redundant enough that we don’t need it, which gets to our next step  

6. Eliminate any unnecessary slow wind-ups

This means eliminate slow beginnings like “I believe that,” “In my opinion,” etc etc. But the intro to this sentence is also unnecessarily slow. We’ve already eliminated some of that here by changing “central to our understanding yada yada” to just “we better understand” - and, as I alluded in the last step, we can eliminate the rest of that wind-up by crossing out “is a careful consideration…”

7. Eliminate any redundancies.

Now, for the last step, let’s find any other redundancies. Take a look at what’s left of the sentence, particularly the prepositional phrases, and think about how you can further edit these phrases. Have someone come up and write alternatives.

“the nature of the human relationships which exist between human beings” —> relationships (maybe human relationships, maybe nature of relationships)
“in D.D 18th century novel Robinson Crusoe” —> novel (unless this is the opening sentence of an essay, but it doesn’t really sound like it)
“print of a human foot” —> “human foot print”
“in which” —> when


I am not, indeed, sure whether it is not true to say that the Milton who once seemed not unlike a seventeenth-century Shelley had not become, out of an experience ever more bitter in each year, more alien [sic] to the founder of that Jesuit sect which nothing could induce him to tolerate.

This story is also one of a rupture between the dream world and the real world, as Morpheus, the god of sleep and producer of dreams, takes the physical and real body of Ceyx out of the ocean and speaks as a phantom through it (as opposed to simply inciting a vision in Alycion’s mind),  

Revision: The dream world and real world intertwine as sleep-God and dream-maker Morpheus speaks through Ceyx's real body rather
