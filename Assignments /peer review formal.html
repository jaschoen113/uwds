<p>Due Friday 9/23
Via Google Docs (your peer's P1 project file)</p>
<p>In the margins, identify the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The clearest statement of an <strong>interpretive problem</strong> Is your classmate's interpretive &quot;problem&quot; stated clearly enough for you to easily understand the interesting tension or complication that your classmate is writing about? Indicate any questions or confusions you have here as a reader, that might your classmate focus, clarify, deepen, or expand their interpretive &quot;problem.&quot;</li>
<li>A summary of the selected <strong>author's primary argument</strong> (that is, Singer's or Grandin's). Does this read as a fair and complete summary? Is any more information needed to make it so?  </li>
<li>One or two places where <strong>evidence</strong> from the text could be clearer or more convincing. Try to indicate why the writer's use of evidence is not as effective as it could be.</li>
<li>Any moments where the writer might not be fully fleshing out the primary text's argument and underlying assumptions. As a reader, did you feel there were places where your classmate could further explore the richness and ambiguity of the subject matter?</li>
<li>Moments when the writer is exploring or making a large <strong>claim</strong>. Do you have suggestions for how they could deepen or expand their claims further? Do the essay’s claims demonstrate listening rhetoric that seeks to deepen or expand understanding of the underlying assumptions involved? Brainstorm for a few sentences about what additional and/or deeper directions you think your classmate could consider going with their claim. In particular:
<ul>
<li>Is your classmate assessing the uses and limits of the text, rather than just criticizing or praising it?</li>
<li>Are there additional opposite, or different, claims that your classmate needs to take into account as counter-arguments?</li>
<li>Are there other ways of seeing your classmate's interpretive &quot;problem&quot; that come to your mind, that your classmate may not have noticed yet?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A clear <strong>motive</strong> (why we should care about what he/she is saying). As a reader was there anything in the essay, or any potential aspect of the subject matter, that might make you care more?</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, in a final comment, list any remaining questions you were left with as a reader. If any marginal notes are running particularly long (i.e. follow-up questions on claims), you can include them in the final comment as well.</p>
<p>Additional notes about giving feedback:</p>
<p>Not only are you attempting to help your peer by providing feedback on their draft, but you are honing your own skills as a critical thinker and essay writer by looking closely at another writer's work.</p>
<p>The following sorts of feedback are not particularly helpful: &quot;I agree/disagree with you because…&quot; or &quot;I think you're wrong because…&quot; or &quot;I think you're writing style needs work because ...&quot; Nor is attention to grammar or syntax necessary at this point. Instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify potential areas for further development in your classmate's draft, and suggest possibilities for developing these ideas into fuller, more complex ideas.</li>
<li>Ask questions that could help your peer step forward in their writing processes. Think about whether the passage(s) your peer chose are important for critical inquiry, and for understanding the text as a whole, and whether your peer has demonstrated close reading skills.</li>
<li>If you don't like something that's happening in your classmate's drafts, rather than just saying &quot;I don't like this part,&quot; as a reviewer you need to dig down and try to identify why you are having the reaction that you are having. For example, is the author making a promise or setting up an expectation that later isn't being met, leaving you feeling frustrated? Try to identify what exactly is going on in your own internal experience.</li>
