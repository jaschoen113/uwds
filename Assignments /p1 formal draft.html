<p>~1000 words</p>
<p>Now that you have explored some interpretive problems in passages from either Grandin or Singer, it's time to shape those ideas into a more formal and cohesive essay.</p>
<p>Remember that the goal of this essay is to help someone read the selected text more deeply, see it in a new light, or understand something about the text that he or she might have missed. You are seeking to illuminate your text for your readers, not simply to say that it is bad or good, likeable or unlikeable, or right or wrong.</p>
<p>As you think about how to structure your draft, consider your readers. What will they need to know in order to appreciate the value of your project? You are writing for astute, general readers who may be completely unfamiliar with your chosen essay and subject matter. Your readers are willing to be generous, as long as you give them a sense that your project matters, and that you have crafted your essay carefully to carry out this project.</p>
<p>Essays of this kind generally accomplish one or more of the following aims:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extend readers’ understanding of a text (“the text is about X, but it’s also about Y”)</li>
<li>Illuminate a lacuna (“we have a gap in our knowledge and this is how to fill it”)</li>
<li>Correct a possible misreading (“we may think it’s X, but actually it is Y”)</li>
<li>Demonstrate the relationship of parts to the whole (“we can’t understand X until we can see Y”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow these basic guidelines as you work formalize your writing:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write a <strong>working title</strong> and <strong>beginning</strong> for your essay’s formal draft. Beginnings of essays serve two overarching purposes: they establish a relation with your readers, and they invite readers to follow your idea or argument. Somewhere in this beginning, present the <strong>author's primary argument</strong>, and specify the <strong>central claims</strong> or <strong>questions</strong> this writer’s text raises for readers. You will also need to present your selected <strong>interpretive problem</strong> and larger <strong>purpose</strong> for this essay: what do you want to illuminate about the text? What gaps or unexplored possibilities do you see in the text, and what do you intend to bring to them? <strong>Establish a claim</strong> that connects your analysis of the passage to the author's larger essay. Then provide a clear <strong>motive</strong> for your claim. Why would your essay matter to your readers? At some point in the beginning you'll also need to <strong>quote</strong> the passage on which you will focus and incorporate it in your essay. Do not simply quote it at the top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draft the <strong>middle</strong> of your essay. The middle of this essay will focus your readers’ attention on specific passages, patterns, and moments from the text that you find most notable. This is your chance to incorporate <strong>close readings</strong>, to <strong>link your claims</strong> by citing <strong>evidence</strong> from different sections of text, and to show what <strong>new insights</strong> you are bringing to the text. As you structure your paragraphs:</p>
<ol>
<li>First identify the individual points that are the basis of your overall claim.</li>
<li>Build body paragraphs around each of these individual points.</li>
<li>Support each particular point with direct quotes from the text (or with cited paraphrases). What is the specific claim, explanation, or example that the author offers in the quotation? This is your evidence.</li>
<li>Then state what you think the author is trying to convey in the quote.</li>
<li>Finally, analyze your evidence. How does the author's specific idea, observation, or example affect our understanding of his or her claims?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Draft a tentative <strong>end</strong> of your essay. The end of the essay does not repeat the beginning, but indicates what we ought to understand or see now about the text you’re working with that we hadn’t noticed before. It can also be a place to consider the broader implications of your project.</li>
</ol>
