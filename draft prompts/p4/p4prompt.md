## P4 Prompt

Proposal due Tuesday 4/27

Final draft due Friday 5/5

Write an op-ed article on any topic that you could submit to a publication of your choice. You may revise one of the papers you’ve written for this class, or you may choose an entirely new argument. Like the previous essays you’ve already written, this assignment requires you to find a question or problem worthy of further analysis, select and close read an exhibit, and make an original claim. However, this assignment is formally and stylistically quite different from the previous ones.

Yours is now a public conversation. This means you should distill your most important ideas into clear, concise prose that will appeal to the specific audience you have identified. From start to finish, imagine the people you’re talking to. Write like your perfectly-articulate, talking self. Consider if your audience might already know the basics of your topic, and therefore what specific context your particular audience will really need to understand your opinion. It’s not that op-eds need NO context, it’s that they require a more targeted kind.

Progression Goals:

1. Choose a reputable **publication** that might be interested in the problem you frame and adhere to the style of that publication.

2. Direct your essay around the **audience** of your chosen publication

3. Develop a **voice** that is clear and engaging, in a tone and style dependent on your audience and  persuasive tactic

4. State your **opinion** clearly, and as quickly as possible

5. Choose an **exhibit** that helps you illustrate your opinion. Your exhibit should probably be news.

6. Use additional **evidence** when necessary, but do not get bogged down by research (this is an opinion piece, not a research paper)

7. **Structure** your essay so that it moves quickly (i.e. avoid large paragraphs)

8. Articulate a **motive.** Op-ed motives are often more obvious than intellectual pieces (for example, calls to action).

Length:

~750 words
