## P3 Formal Draft Peer Review

Due Friday 4/15

As with previous peer reviews, aim for at least one marginal note per page as well as an end-line comment. Look toward the P3 checklist and prompt for feedback guidance. And remember to comment by explaining your experience as a reader rather than by judging the piece as an editor or critic.
