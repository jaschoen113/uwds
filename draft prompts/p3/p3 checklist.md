## P3 Checklist

**Exhibit**
- Is the exhibit ambivalent? Can it be interpreted in many ways?  
- Does the exhibit produce an intriguing research question and claim?
- Does the writer sufficiently describe the exhibit? Does he/she provide too much unnecessary description?

**Research Question**
- Will the question allow the researcher to develop her own claim, a claim that could be debated? (As opposed to a question with an obvious or already settled answer)
- Is the question too broad? Too narrow?
- Does the question lead to specific and dynamic research?

**Claim***
- Does the writer have a single overarching claim (thesis)?
- Does the claim answer the research question?  
- Is the claim evaluative or analytical?
- Is the claim original?
- By the end of the paper, has the claim been reiterated enough for you to fully understand it?
- Are there counter-arguments the writer should take into account?

**Research**
- Is there a mix of sources and source types (books, scholarly journal articles, etc)?
- Is there a mix of source function (authorizing, illustrating, borrowing, extending)?

**Evidence**
- Does the writer incorporate sources seamlessly into his/her paper? Does he/she introduce, cite, and engage with each quote?
- Do he/she use each source to either provide critical background necessary to understand the eventual claim or to directly develop the claim?
- Are sources used throughout the paper or mostly collected in one section?
- Do sources all seem directly relevant to the writerâ€™s question/claim?
- Are more sources needed for evidence/support of certain claims?
- Does the writer close read the exhibit? Do these close readings complicate and develop the claims?
- Does the writer rely too heavily on quotations? Does the writer need more quotations?

**Structure**
- Does the current progression of the essay make sense to you?
- Does each paragraph have a specific purpose (background, exhibit analysis, etc)? Is that purpose signaled early on in the paragraph?
- Are paragraphs organized analytically or categorically? That is, are they organized around claims, or are they simply a collection of information?
- Do paragraphs clearly build up to or develop a larger claim (even if the claim isn't explicitly mentioned until later in the essay)?
- Are transitions between paragraphs clear?
- Are transitions between sentences clear?

**Motive**
- Does the writer identify a motive for his/her essay in the introduction? That is, does he/she make it clear why the reader should keep reading the essay?
- Is the motive too extreme (stakes so high they are unbelievable) or too minimal (stakes so low they do not warrant further reading)?

**Implications**
- Does the writer move beyond his main claim (thesis) in the conclusion to discuss the larger implications of that claim?
- Are those implications believable? Are they too much of a leap? Are they interesting, exciting, or surprising? Do they leave you with a new appreciation of the writer's argument?

**Citations**
- Does the writer use properly formatted in-text citations?
- Does the writer include a properly formatted works cited page?

**Introduction and Claims**
- Does the introduction engage the reader and encourage him/her to keep reading?
- Does the conclusion leave the reader with a lasting impression of the essay?
