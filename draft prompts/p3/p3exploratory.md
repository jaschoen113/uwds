## P3 Exploratory Draft

Due Monday 4/3

~700 words

As with previous exploratory drafts, you should use this assignment to explore new ideas through the process of writing. But the majority of your "exploration" in this draft will be outside the actual written draft and instead in your research.

"Researching" does not mean finding the first 7 sources related to virtual reality and sticking them in this paper. Researching means reading through many, many more sources than you will actually include in your paper in order to select the ones that are most useful for you.

If by the end of this exercise you have adjusted your research topic and question, that is perfectly understandable (and often the case in research projects). Include a brief summary of the change (2-3 sentences) at the end of the draft.

After you have read through at least 12 potential sources, select **six**. Comment on each of them as follows:

    1. List the MLA citation for each source.

    2. Provide a brief summary of the source's main argument and project. (1-2 sentences)

    3. Describe how you will use this source. Will it be a source for illustrating, authorizing, borrowing, or extending? (see Harris, "Forwarding," for a reminder on these terms)

    4. Explain how this source intersects with your own research project. What new information or conceptual framework does this source provide that might shape your own ideas?

    5. Include essential quotes or paraphrases that you imagine using in your paper. What specific idea or quote from the author will be useful for your specific project? (It might be the general argument of the piece if you are
    "borrowing" the source, or it might be a specific detail if you are "authorizing" your paper with the source)

Keep in mind that you should be evaluating the authority, audience, and motive of each source, and striving for a balance of source-types. Are the majority of your sources newspaper articles? And does that weaken your own argument? Are all of your sources authorizing sources? And does that limit the conceptual framework of your paper?

5. (~250 words) Write a single paragraph that looks closely at your exhibit and incorporates at least one of your sources. This would probably not be the first, second, or even third paragraph of your paper (which might be more background information), and might not even make it into your formal or final draft. But regardless, write up one formal paragraph that you think sits somehow at the crux of your research project (maybe it's a key close reading of your exhibit, maybe it's a key application of a conceptual framework to your exhibit, etc).
