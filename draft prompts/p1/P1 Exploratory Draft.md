#P1 Exploratory Draft

Due  **Tuesday 1/31**

700-900 words

The purpose of this draft is to explore your ideas through the act of writing. This is an **informal** document. You should focus on content rather than form. Try not to stop writing even if you're not quite sure where a point may be going. Explore each potential idea and see if the very act of writing can get you to a larger claim. Don't worry too much about structure, but begin a new paragraph/section every time you do something new.

These are the general objectives for this draft:

1.  Select whether you'd like to write on **Turing**, **Jamison**, or **Martin** (you can only write on one text for this progression).

2.  Select a passage or pattern of passages that has rich language and/or form that you can interpret originally. Type the passage(s) in a document and cite the page number(s).

3. **Reread the passage(s)** you've chosen, then **reread the entire essay**, making note of any details that are particularly relevant to your selected passage(s).

4. Analyze the passage(s) you've chosen. Look **closely at the text**, trying to extract as much as you can from the language and structure of the writing. Don't worry about writing a proper introduction just yet -- just focus on close reading.

5. Work your close readings into larger **claims** about the text as a whole. Think about how your textual observations connect to the author's larger project. By the end of the draft, reach a major claim that might serve as your thesis.

If you are still struggling to select a passage(s), here are some tips:

- Select a passage(s) that requires interpretation, has terms that shift in meaning, and/or has claims that suggest significant room for debate. Don't select a passage that simply declares a basic point or sum up the author's ideas.   
- A passage may be a single sentence or several sentences long. A pattern may be a term/expression/image/device/question, etc. that occurs in different places throughout the essay. But you shouldn't just be piling up examples; you need to raise a _specific_ interpretation as a result of a _specifc_ observation.

If you are still struggling to interpret your passage(s), here are some questions you might ask yourself:

- What is the author saying in this passage? What is the author *doing* in this passage? How do they relate?
- Why might the author choose these specific terms to convey his/her point?
- Why might the author choose these specific images to convey his/her point?
- Why might the author structure his/her argument this way?
- What makes this passage stand out from the rest of the text?
- Are there any assumptions that the author makes, either explicitly or implicitly? How does recognizing those assumptions change how we understand his or her argument?
- Why does the author choose this particular evidence or particular kind of evidence?  
- Do any passages from the rest of the text support your interpretation of this particular passage?
