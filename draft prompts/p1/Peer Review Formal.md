##P1 Formal Draft Peer Review

Due **Friday 2/10**

Peer reviews work similarly to our Writing Responses, except that you are the only reader of your peer's draft. As a result, you should make more than two or three marginal notes. Aim for at least one marginal note per page, along with an end-comment. As with the Writing Responses, look towards the P1 Prompt and Checklist for feedback inspiration. Focus on big picture items (structure, argument, etc) before stylistic issues; however, if you notice a recurring stylistic problem (several run-on sentences, lots of spelling errors, several lengthy and confusing sentences, etc) you can make a note of it.  

Keep in mind that the following sorts of feedback are not particularly helpful: "I agree/disagree with you because…" or "I think you're wrong because…" or "I think your writing style needs work because ..." Instead:

- Identify potential areas for further development in your classmate's draft, and suggest possibilities for developing these ideas into fuller, more complex ideas.
- Ask questions that could help your peer step forward in their writing processes. Think about whether the passage(s) your peer chose are important for critical inquiry, and for understanding the text as a whole, and whether your peer has demonstrated close reading skills.
- If you don't like something that's happening in your classmate's drafts, rather than just saying "I don't like this part," as a reviewer you need to dig down and try to identify why you are having the reaction that you are having. For example, is the author making a promise or setting up an expectation that later isn't being met, leaving you feeling frustrated? Try to identify what exactly is going on in your own internal experience.
