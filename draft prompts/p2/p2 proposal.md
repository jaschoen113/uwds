## P2 Proposal

Due Thursday 2/23

~500 words

Select **three** potential exhibits for your P2 paper. For each, propose a project around that exhibit. Then briefly asses the strengths and limits of that project. A paragraph per exhibit should suffice.

Detail the following for each proposed exhibit:

1. Briefly describe the exhibit (no more than 1-2 sentences).

2. Describe what makes this exhibit a contender for rich interpretation. What do you find interesting, engaging, surprising, confusing, or shocking about this exhibit?

3. List the two essays you would put this exhibit in conversation with. 

4. Describe the academic conversation that you would enter via this exhibit and the two essays.

5. Assess the exhibit based on:
    - **Manageability**: Is the exhibit too expansive or too restrictive? Can it easily be explained for an unfamiliar reader, so that you can move quickly to your interesting claims about it?
    - **Relevance**: Does the exhibit really engage with questions raised by the essays, or do you have to stretch to make it relate to that conversation? A stretch can okay, as long as you ultimately reach a dynamic claim which directly relates to the academic conversation. But if you have to spend the majority of your paper simply justifying why the exhibit might be thought of as relating to this conversation, then you might want to choose a more straightforward example.
    - **Ambivalence**: Can the exhibit be interpreted in multiple different ways? And can you develop an interesting and original interpretation of this exhibit?
