- Go over general admin/layout of the class
- Discuss active reading and annotation techniques
- Introduce close reading skills

##Brief Introduction (5 mins)
- Introduce myself
- Welcome to University Writing - a class designed to introduce undergrads to academic writing and develop fundamental writing skills. Our section is specifically Data Sciences and Engineering themed, meaning that we will be reading texts that feed into academic debates specifically concerning the science and engineering community, but also, as you will see, asking more universal questions. I'm going to go over the goals of this class and what our themed section means in a couple minutes. But first I want us to start getting to know each other.

##Ice Breaker (10 mins)
- Since this is a seminar much of our class will be discussion-based, and we will also be reading each other's writing and constantly engaging with each other's ideas. So it is important that we get to know each other.
- Play name-game (ask if their names have any story attached to them, if not it's fine) - make everyone say the name that came before (then I'll try)

##Course Goals (15 minutes)

(3 minutes)

- Okay now, I want us to start thinking about the the goals of this course.
- We will be learning how to write academic papers. Since academic writing can greatly vary across disciplines, this class will not prepare you for a specific kind of academic writing. Rather, we will be developing fundamental skills that you can carry across disciplines. Since we are focused on academic writing, our assumed audience will be smart academic readers--in other words, your peers in this room, in your other classes, and in your future academic environments.
- Since this class is themed "Data Sciences and Engineering", all of our reading will be engaging with academic conversations around data sciences and engineering. This means that your essays - which will be working with our readings - will be engaging with those conversations. So we can think of the theme as a kind of inspiration for our writing, though the primary goal of this class is to work on writing itself. This class does not presume any knowledge of science or engineering, or any intention of majoring in science or engineering. I myself am studying medieval English literature, so my specialty pretty far removed from modern technology. But I am still very interested in these present technological debates, as I hope you will be as you read our primary texts. To me, the most important part of the writing process is selecting a topic that interests you, and finding that interest even in conversations that you might never have considered interesting before. So, even if you have no explicit interest in data science or engineering, I am confident you will find something interesting in our readings and discussions to passionately write about in your essays.

(5 minutes)

Now, what are our specific writing goals for this class?

I want us to take a couple minutes to reflect on our writing. Please get a sheet of paper to write on, and for the next couple minutes I want you to write a response to one or two or all of these questions:

1) What do you find most difficult about writing?
2) Has anyone ever told you something about your writing that you agree you need to work on?
3) What are you worried about in transitioning your writing from high school level to undergraduate level?

We're going to be doing a lot of free-writing like this in class. The goal here is to really "word vomit." Don't go for polished writing - just write whatever comes to your mind. I'll never cold call on you to read out what you've written. This exercise serves mainly as a springboard for our discussions.

(8 minutes)

Does anyone want to share anything they've come up with? (repeat questions); if no one volunteers, say something I want to work on with my own writing to open things up (i.e. revise my drafts more boldly/kill my darlings)

Some possible goals to bring up:

1. Write essays that an audience would want to read based on the strength and originality of their ideas, Accurate and insightful work with sources, and formal coherence (even beauty)
2. Anticipate and fulfill expectations of readers of your essays
3. Read actively, annotate source material, and take notes that will help you at later stages of writing
4. Present, analyze, reflect on sources and cite them
5. Adopt a problem- and inquiry-based approach to finding a project of your own
6. Propose, assess, and revise an academic writing project
7. Generate your own ideas in relationship to source materials that you encounter
8. Choose from common formal structures at the sentence, paragraph, and section levels and invent new ones
9. Provide, receive, and incorporate the responses of other writers to your work
10. Radically revise your drafts, postponing the moment at which your work on an essay is complete
11. Proofread and refine the most public versions of your work
12. Reflect on your own preferences and habits as a reader, writer, speaker, and thinker in order to sustain and enhance those that are helpful to you and to change or eliminate those that are blocking your development
13. Adopt multiple roles in a seminar setting to enrich discussion, support the intellectual community of a class, and listen with purpose

Syllabus Overview (15 min)
- Read through syllabus with them, highlighting the 4 progressions, the 3 themes (animal rights, artificial intelligence, posthumanism), the different draft versions, the purpose of exercises, general admin (google site vs courseworks vs hardcopy), conferences, office hours

##Annotation & Close Reading Exercise (30 minutes)

- Now we're going to begin working on our writing. To write well, first we have to make sure we're reading well. In the next half hour I want to go over active reading strategies (basically, annotation) and then move into close reading, a strategy that we will be developing throughout this entire class and especially in this first progression.

TWO OPTIONS (??):

1) Handout Patricia Klein (who goes over both close reading and annotation) and have everyone read that to themselves (should take about 6 minutes). Then ask for her main points/strategies and write on them on the board, while going over them (8 minutes). Then make sure the terms "tension", "contradiction," "ambiguity" and "observation" and "claim" are the main words we're focusing on, and explain them in more detail (4 minutes). Whenever annotation strategies come up, ask the class what strategies they use/have been taught and collet them on the board; discuss why the like/dislike certain strategies, propose any strategies that don't come up in discussion (6 minutes). This only leaves about 6 minutes for a sample passage for everyone to try out themselves.

2) Start with a sample passage (??) (handout). Before they read it, tell them to 1) annotate/mark up the page along the way in anyway they know how/feel instinctually. Tell them to think about 2) a general summary of the passage but to also look for 3) any tension/contradiction/ambiguity (in other words anything unnerving/illogical/strange). Have them read (10 minutes total so far). Then ask them again, any tension/contradiction/ambiguity? List them on the board. Now, can we pick one observation from this list that we think we can make a claim about? In other words, can we connect any of these observations to the larger "point" of the passage? Do any of these observations change/reinforce/complicate our understanding of the larger text? (10 minutes). Make sure tension/contradiction/ambiguity and claim/observation are circled on board. Then ask them how they annotated this text. Make a separate list of their techniques, discuss why they chose each one, and put up any techniques they haven't mentioned (10 minutes). Assign Klein for homework as an additional guide to close reading.

Possible sample passages: "Borges and I"; excerpt from Plato's "Phaedrus" on writing; poem by melville (the maldive shark); robert burns "to a mouse"; james leigh hunt, "to a fish"/"fish answers"; carter revard "birch canoe"; seamus heaney "trout"
