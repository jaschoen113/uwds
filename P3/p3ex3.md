P3 Exercise 3
Due Thursday 11/3

Find 3 potential sources. Each source should be a different type of source (i.e. chapter from a book, article in a scholarly journal, article in a newspaper/magazine). Then for each source:

1. List the MLA citation for each source.

2. Provide a brief summary of the source's main argument and project.

3. Describe how you will use this source. Will it be a source for illustrating, authorizing, borrowing, or extending? (Here is an [article](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B3k284_PDVjDUVozU2VFT2tPeGc) describing each of these terms in depth to help you further distinguish between them.)

4. Explain how this source intersects with your own research project. What new information or conceptual framework does this source provide that might shape your own ideas?

5. After commentating on each of your sources, write generally about your research process so far. Were these sources difficult to find? Were they as useful as you needed them to be? Do you imagine you will be able to find more sources easily? As you begin your research, you might find that your current exhibit or current research question is not producing the most interesting research (this might be because your guiding research question is too broad or narrow, people have already written extensively on that specific question, or your exhibit doesn't lend itself to a rich interpretive problem). This is the time to assess the limits of your research project and decide whether you still want to continue with this specific virtual reality exhibit and/or this specific angle of research around your exhibit.
