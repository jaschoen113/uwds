P3 Exercise 4
Due Tuesday 11/15

Re-read Booth's "Planning and Drafting" and "Quick Tip: Outlines" (In 11/10 reading folder)

Sketch a potential outline of your paper. Here are some tips to follow:

- Decide how where you want to state your main claim (do you want it clear from the introduction? or do you want to build to it?)

- Decide where background/context will be most useful for the reader (upfront, spread throughout, some combination). Then briefly sketch what background information you think a reader will **absolutely** need to understand your argument (again, outline this information, don't write it up yet)

- Organize your paper by analytical categories, not topics of data

- Consider where to place your sources. You don't necessarily need to include all 9 sources in your outline, but if, for example, you are using a source as a key theoretical framework, you'll definitely want to include the position of that source

- Play with several different orders of your argument's progression, until you find the one that will best help your reader understand your claim

Begin writing formal paragraphs. Remember that your formal draft is due Tuesday 11/22, and must be at least 2000 words. Your final draft will be 2400-3000 words. Also keep in mind that you need **7-9** sources for your final draft. Reach out to me if you think you'll need to use more than 9 sources.
