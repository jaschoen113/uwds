## Lesson Plan 16

- Discuss Hayles more (30 minutes)
- Discuss potential virtual reality exhibits, what we think might make an exhibit better or worse for a research paper  

Discussing Hayles (15 minutes)
- Collect a running list of intersecting conversations. Have a few people guide us to their selected quotes. What is the conversation she is entering here? How does she enter that conversation (directly quoting or citing sources/briefly mentioning them)? Then just gather a list of conversations without looking at quotes.

Source Work with Hayles (20 minutes)
- Scan through the citations at the end of the seed text. What kinds of sources are these? Technical/scientific, literary, literary criticism, sociological, philosophical? Books, articles, newspapers, films?
- Now let's look at the sources within Hayles. We can divide kinds of sources into 4 types:
1. Illustrating: when you look at other texts for examples of the point you want to make (anecdotes, images, scenarios, exhibits)
2. Authorizing: when you evoke the status or expertise of another writer to support your thinking (stereotypical research sources, what other people have written on this topic)
3. Borrowing: when you draw on terms or ideas from other writers to use in thinking through your subject (often texts not directly related to topic on hand, but have ideas/concepts/theories that can be imported for thinking about your topic)
4. Extending: when you put your spin on terms or concepts that you take from other texts (like borrowing, but manipulating ideas, putting your own spin on them in relation to your research project... instead of "as x says," playing off of what x says)
- Let's try to find examples of these in Hayles. Look for places when she is using a source, and identify in the margins what kind of source-work it is.
- Where are most of her sources accumulating? What are the benefits and drawbacks of that kind of structure?

Discuss Virtual Reality
- Now I want to start a discussion about our potential exhibits. After you've taken a look around exhibits, what were you finding that intrigued you, that seemed like it would be a more or less useful center point of your research?
- Now that you've looked at some other VR films, what are some potential conversations besides the ones Hayles brings up? This can be even if you've  just read about them online, and haven't even seen them.
- Collect list on board
- Free-write, in preparation for research and library session: As you start your research, what obstacles do you imagine coming up against? Where do you think you'll start your research? What questions do you have for librarian on research tools or strategies? Either related to virtual reality and your potential research project specifically, or about Columbia's research tools and materials?

Tuesday we will be meeting in the library, Butler 306 at 11:40. Your exercise 2 will be to try to select and exhibit and potential research question around the exhibit. The library session will be a lesson and not just us researching on our own, though hopefully there's a bit of that. So it will be useful to have a general sense of what direction your research project will take you, but it's okay if after Tuesday you change your exhibit. If you go to start researching and you realize there's nothing on your topic and need to change your exhibit, that might happen and that's fine. For next Thursday, however, your exercise will be selected 3 sources and discussing them in relation to your exhibit. Then we have a week and your exploratory draft is due the following Thursday (exploratory draft is going to be more of a project proposal along with 6 sources). Then there is a week and a half for the formal draft.
