LP 23

- Discussion of comments (20 minutes)
- Intros and Conclusions (25-35 minutes)
- Free-write and discussion about current research stage

Discussion of comments/general writing state

- What are the most common comments you have been receiving from either me or your peers? Judging from this feedback, what are your biggest writing goals at the moment? Take out your P2 final papers or previous project files and read through comments if necessary.
Collect answers on board
- Start brainstorming improvement plans. Has anyone been struggling with any of these issues as well and found useful tricks/methods to help? If you know that, say, a common issue for you has been using specific evidence, developing precise close readings, how you might you actively confront that problem in your P3 formal draft?

Intros and Conclusions

- Intros and conclusions can sometimes seem like the least important part of our papers. We often write them last, and rely on cliches and overused formulas, simply filling in our main ideas in trite templates. But intros and conclusions are important for several reasons -- from the reader's perspective, your intro will determine whether they will keep reading, and your conclusion will leave them with the last impression of your essay. From your perspective as a writer, an intro requires you to determine the pace and tone of your whole essay, and a conclusion forces you to consider the final stakes of your essay. So I want to take some time today to look at various introductions and conclusions and consider what makes them effective or ineffective.

Do a 10 minute lesson with the Booth?? Before or after?

New Yorker Exercise (25 minutes)

- Everyone gets a New Yorker. Find an essay (not fiction) and read just the intro and conclusion. Try to identify the rhetorical strategy of each, and write down what you think is effective about each.
Introductions:
  - Read some first lines outloud. What are they doing? Are they setting a scene? Are they narrative, specific? Are they abstract? Are they funny? Serious?
  - Think about entire introductions. Can you get a sense of what the essay will be about from the introduction? Can you grasp a claim, or does it seem the author will build to a claim?
  - What can you emulate from these introductions in your own writing?
  - Read some first lines outloud. What are they doing? Are they setting a scene? Are they narrative, specific? Are they abstract? Are they funny? Serious?
Conclusions:
  - What is different about the conclusion vs the introduction? Can you tell an entire essay has come between (not just repeating the introduction)?
  - Has it moved towards a claim? Does it provide a clear motive/the stakes of the essay?
  - Read some final lines. What are they doing? Are they setting a scene? Are they narrative, specific? Are they abstract? Are they funny? Serious?  

Try to collect some of the ideas on the board.

Free-write and discussion (20 minutes)

- Take about 5 minutes to write about your current stage in the research process. What are you confident about right with your paper? What major obstacles are you still facing?
  - Are you struggling to find certain sources?
  - Are you unsure about how to structure your paper?
  - Are are you unsure about the parameters of your research question?
  - Have you begun to develop a claim yet?

Then I'd like 2 or 3 people to present to the class, and we'll have a discussion.
  - Briefly describe your research project (topic, question, claim, if you have one yet), and whatever you are still struggling with
  - As people are discussing, rest of class should close laptops, jot down notes or question
