Nagel Presentation and Discussion (35 minutes)



Cohesion and Coherence

Cohesion: at the sentence level. The glue between the sentences. Does each sentence flow into the next? Are there proper transitions between each sentence?

Complete handout

Coherence: at the paragraph or essay level. The logic of the entire paragraph makes sense, there is a clear, coherent purpose to the entire paragraph. The logic of the entire essay makes sense, it is about one narrow topic, it makes one clear argument.

Complete exercise

Point: you want to make sure that you transition between sentences, but also that your larger paragraph and essay also moves to a coherent idea
