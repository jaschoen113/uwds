From Topics to Questions/Questions to problems (30 minutes)  

- Get out the Booth from Topics to Questions/from Questions to Problems
- We're going to use the template that he provides on p. 49 of "From Topics to Questions" for our own stage in the research process:

I am trying to learn about (working on, studying) ________

because I want to find out who/what/when/where/whether/why/how ________

in order to help my read understand how/why/whether __________

- Now I was wondering if we could get two or three volunteers to fill in the templates so that we might discuss them as a group.
  - Is the topic too broad? Too focused/narrow?
  - Does the question have an easily found answer? Does the question have a settled/fact answer? Will the question allow the researcher to develop her own claim? Does the question narrow the topic? Will the question guide specific and dynamic research? Can you imagine there being enough but not too much search results for this question?
  - Is the motive too much of a stretch? Is it a convincing reason to read this paper? Higher/lower stakes?

General Source Discussion (Remaining Time)
- What are you guys finding difficult about the research process? Has anyone found that problem and a solution?
- What is your note-taking strategy?
- How are you determining which sources to keep/not keep?
- How much time are you spending reading over sources?
- Where have you guys started your research, were some databases more useful or less useful?
