Workshop (30 minutes)

Practice Gathering Sources (20 minutes)
- In pairs, take a look at the three example topic, problem, and questions, pick one
- Your task is to find two sources that you imagine being useful for this specific project
- First brainstorm the "types" of sources you imagine being useful for this paper -- both in form (article, book, journal, etc) and content (for example, a book that develops a feminist theory vs a research study with women involved, so a source for "borrowing" vs a source for "authorizing")
- Then go looking for the two sources -- talk through where you want to look first (Clio, Google, a specific database, etc) -- I suggest at least looking at the research guide on our Courseworks page. If you are having trouble finding a source through one method, then try another.
- Write down the sources you do manage to find, and think about how they compared to your conception of them -- do you still want a better source? do you think you just need more time to look for it? or do you need to start looking for a new kind of source? might you want to change your imagined methodology as a result?

Share and compare topic, research, question (15 minutes):


General Source Discussion (15 minutes)
- Take a couple minutes to free write about research process so far:
  - What are you finding difficult about research so far? Any specific kind of source you're having trouble finding?
  - What has worked for you so far? Any search terms, fields, or strategies that delivered better results?
  - Have you found some databases more useful or less useful?
  - Do you have a skim-reading strategy?  How much time are you spending reading over sources?
  - How are you determining which sources to keep/not keep?
  - What is your note-taking strategy?
