LP 21

Schedule:
- McLuhan Presentation and Discussion (35 minutes)
- Something else (30-40 minutes)

Maybe:
- Everyone take out paper. Write a random sentence. Pass it to person the right. Person writes a sentence that logically follows that sentence, then folds previous sentence. Then we'll read some out loud
- Take-aways: even when you are connecting all the sentences, the larger whole might not be cohesive. We want to make sure that we transition smoothly between sentences, but that our larger paragraph has a coherent point - that you could sum up the paragraph in a topic sentence (even if you aren't starting with a "topic sentence")
