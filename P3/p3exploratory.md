## P3 Exploratory Draft

As with previous exploratory drafts, you should use this assignment to explore new ideas through the process of writing. But the majority of your "exploration" in this draft will be outside the actual written draft and instead in your research. "Researching" does not mean finding the first 7 sources related to virtual reality and sticking them in this paper. Researching means reading/reading over many, many more sources than you will actually include in your paper in order to select the ones that are most useful for you.

Because a research essay requires you to tailor your research according to your research question, by the end of this exercise you should have a narrow and original research question. I've broken this exploratory draft down between your own claims and your research. But you will inevitably work between the various sections as you research/write. For example, you might start with a research question in section 1, but as you add more sources to section 3, you might tweak and develop that question in section 1.  

1. (~300-500 words) Describe your general research project/topic. Make sure to accomplish the following:
  - Describe the exhibit you have chosen
  - Describe what specifically you are examining about the exhibit
  - Describe the larger conversation you are entering via your exhibit (historical/cultural conversation or genre conversation - and which specific one). You might include some preliminary research here, or at least a summary of background research. That is, include the more "encyclopedic" research that sets the context for your specific research question.
  - Describe how your exhibit intersects with that conversation  

2. (~100 words) Pose three to five investigative questions. These are your guiding research questions. Remember that some questions are too general (e.g. “How does virtual reality impact the viewer?”) and others have obvious answers (e.g. “Is virtual reality a different viewer experience than a normal film?”). We want to avoid those. Try to stray away from questions that begin with "Is/Does/Can/Should…" and instead gravitate "What/How/Why/To what extent/…"" Remember that strong investigative questions are specific and narrow.

4. (~100 words) Articulate the motive and stakes of your research project: What will your readers realize about the conversation/exhibit if you answer your questions? What will we fail too see if you don’t answer these questions?

    If you're struggling with sections 1 & 2 & 3, return to the templates and explanations in "From Topics to Questions" and "From Questions to Problems." You are essentially expanding on your topic (section 1) question (section 2) and problem (section 3).

3. (~700 words) Select 6 sources and comment on them as you did with exercise 3:
    1. List the MLA citation for each source.

    2. Provide a brief summary of the source's main argument and project. (1-2 sentences)

    3. Describe how you will use this source. Will it be a source for illustrating, authorizing, borrowing, or extending? (Here is an [article](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B3k284_PDVjDUVozU2VFT2tPeGc) describing each of these terms in depth to help you further distinguish between them.)

    4. Explain how this source intersects with your own research project. What new information or conceptual framework does this source provide that might shape your own ideas?

    5. Include essential quotes or paraphrases that you imagine using in your paper. What specific idea or quote from the author will be useful for your specific project? (It might be the general argument of the piece if you are
    "borrowing" the source, or it might be a specific detail if you are "authorizing" your paper with the source)

      You can use the 3 sources you found for exercise 3 if you are still committed to them after further research (though you might have found better sources and decided against them by now). Keep in mind that you should be evaluating the authority, audience, and motive of each source, and striving for a balance of source-types. Are the majority of your sources newspaper articles? And does that weaken your own argument? Are all of your sources authorizing sources? And does that limit the conceptual framework of your paper?


5. (~250 words) Begin combining these elements. Write a single paragraph that looks closely at your exhibit and incorporates at least one of your sources. This would probably not be the first, second, or even third paragraph of your paper (which might be more background information), and might not even make it into your formal or final draft. But regardless, write up one formal paragraph that you think sits somehow at the crux of your research project (maybe it's a key close reading of your exhibit, maybe it's a key application of a conceptual framework to your exhibit, etc).
