Style workshop
- Now we're going to do some sentence level revision
- Hopefully you had a chance to look over revising style again, which I think is a very helpful guide to revising sentences
- I want you to all look through your drafts and find one "bad" sentence. This might be a sentence that you think you'll completely revise in your final draft, or one that you might even take out completely. But I want to get a couple of these sentences on the board, since I think we all run into similar stylistic problems, and revising one or two of these sentences on the board as a group will be helpful for everyone.  
- So this might be sentence that your peer has singled out (maybe they've noted that they didn't understand one particular sentence), a sentence you didn't have time to edit last night, or maybe a sentence that now you see is confusing
  - You might remember some of the tips from "Revising Style" - make central characters subjects of your verbs, and keep those subjects short and specific; use verbs to express crucial actions; get rid of preposition clutters; get rid of unnecessary/abstract nominalizations  - if you have a sentence with any of these issues

For next Tuesday - read through op-ed packet, and overview of the op-ed. Writing exercise 1, which will be reading through the op-ed packet and selecting one op-ed that you particularly enjoyed, and discuss (paragraph, about 300 words) how the tone and style was different from essays we've writing so far, and what you thought was particularly successful in the piece.
