  - A potential interpretive problem (If the writer seems to have several interpretive problems, identify which one you think he/she currently gravitating towards
  - A potential claim deriving from an interpretive problem
  - Again, if there are several claims, identify the primary claim you see he/she arguing 
  - Ideas that intrigue you and you are curious to see expanded
  - Ideas that you do not see connecting to the interpretive problem/primary claim
