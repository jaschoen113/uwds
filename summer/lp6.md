Conferences next week @ my office hours

##General
- Problem getting drafts on time - taking points off grade and they are not graded assignments. Important to communicate. Discuss. Will do exercise after workshop.

##Workshop
- Tell us generally what stage you're at, what you're having difficulty with. Try not to talk during the actual workshop (unless you have to answer a question). I'm also going to try not to talk for a lot of the workshop (unless asked a question).

##Writing Exercise
- Select an idea that you had difficulty writing about. For this assignment, the easiest thing might be to select a specific close reading you had difficulty fleshing out. If you ended up writing a bit on it, that's fine, if you didn't really write much on it, that's fine too. This should be an idea that you imagine taking a few sentences to a paragraph to explain.
- Talk to the person next to you about the idea. As the person talks, the other person should be taking notes. Then the other person should try to reiterate that idea. If they didn't get it right, correct them and make sure they get it right.
- After you've both done this, turn to your Google Doc or computer. Now imagine you're chatting with your friend online. You want to tell them everything you just told your partner. So write out those ideas with your friend in mind - you can talk in whatever voice you would usually speak online if that helps. You can use like um lol whatever you usually would use. Try not to consult the text, just write from your memory.
- Now, when you're done writing, look back at that paragraph. Now try to complete sentences, erase redundancies, take out the "likes" and the "lols". If you need a more specific quote from the essay, now you can put it in.
- Now share this paragraph with your peer. As you guys are reading each other's paragraphs, think about whether this matched what you originally discussed. Comment on what needs clarifying still.
