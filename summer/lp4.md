##Admin
- Everyone fill out Doodle
- Also need to fill out workshops: need volunteers for Wednesday, who will have their formal drafts for Tuesday (this is going to happen for all the workshops)


##TMR
- I asked you to identify the argument and moments of close reading; we'll start there and then we'll move on to some other items on the checklist
- Fill out worksheet in pairs, then make reverse outline on board
- Let's try to reconstruct how the argument develops:
  - What passage selected? Why is this a passage worth examining? What makes it special, what makes it complicate the text at large?
    - The question, "do monsters really exist?" It potentially undermines the larger argument, making it an exceptional and important part of the piece. She can read its form (as a question), she can also read its language (symptom, anxiety, etc).
  - How does the writer close read the passage? Look at specific moments of close reading
    - Looks at specific words like "surely" and "perhaps"; also looks at the form of the question ("Cohen demands a definite answer")
  - How does the writer connect the writing to the meaning of the passage? How does a close examination of form, word choice, rhetorical moves lead to a deeper understanding of the text?
    - Links confident language to playing with our egos (increasing our anxiety, something investigated in the theory), links language of anxiety to anxiety, links to indeterminacy of the question to anxiety
  - What is the main argument of this piece? Where is it?
    - The question is really testing reader's level of thought and whether they will give in easily to a certain argument because they are uneasy; this readerly anxiety parallels the anxiety of the monster; and this kind of anxiety reinforces unthought  
    - Summary (Cohen): Anxiety creates monsters and monsters inspire anxiety. Observation: Cohen asks a question "do monsters really exist?" which potentially undermines his entire argument Interpretation: The question creates an anxiety in the reader that parallels the anxiety created by the monster. Larger claim: The reader's readiness to accept his answer (out of anxiety) reaffirms Cohen's point about "unthought" - the reader enacts unthought
  - How does the writer introduce the larger project of "Monster Culture"? How much context does she give? How much does she use the rest of the text (parts that are not from her passage)?
    - Mostly in the second paragraph; lays out main project, primary investigation, even describes academic tone; gives enough information about his argument/tone so that the reader will understand argument later on (i.e. relationship between anxiety and monsters)
  - How might you describe this essay's structure?
    - introduction, context, passage, back-up/tone, close reading/building anticipation, close reading/proding ego, close reading/anxiety, lays out claim/connects close readings, conclusion/re-articulating claim/moving onto implications
  - How would you describe the tone and style of the piece?
    - mostly scholarly, occasionally dramatized
  - What kind of audience do you think this piece is directed towards? Who might be interested in this piece?
    - people who have read "monster culture", people who are interested in "anxious reading", people interested in rhetorical questions, people interested in how authors engage/affect their audiences  

- Now reverse engineer the essay. Assign everyone a paragraph. Say what that paragraph is doing and saying. For example, first paragraph "introduces her selected passage from "Monster Culture" and points out its significance (risks the author's argument)". Everyone do that for their 2 paragraphs (is it close reading, more introduction, counter argument, etc). When you're done, put them on the board.

- Now let's understand this argument progression.

- Picking a passage vs pattern of passage. If picking a passage, need to make sure separate close readings connect to each other (for example, in the TMR, constantly links his various close readings to anxiety he's producing). Be wary of reading each sentence in a very different way, such that the close readings don't collectively work towards a larger argument. If selecting a larger pattern, you might face the opposite problem - have a bunch of similar examples that just pile on top of each other, and can't complicate your argument. So make sure each example can add something new to your argument.

##Formal Draft Overview
- Due Wednesday

##Working from exploratory
- Everyone to try to map out at least one close reading from exploratory draft. Minor or major close reading (major close reading from TMR would be the question, minor close reading would be "perhaps"). Summary/Observation/Interpretation. Then share with partner. Ideally partner you had last time.

##Reading for Monday
- Another example of good close reading. We'll have a discussion per usual, but in our discussion we'll also really focus on how she close reads herself (you can't write about this essay for P1). Just have her as a model in your mind, more than necessarily an object of investigation/interpretation as we have had for Jamison/Ford. But you'll still make a discussion question according to your category.
