##Martin discussion
- Martin serves as a particularly useful model for our own essays, since she engages in close reading; for this reason, I thought we could read Martin like we did the TMR article
- What is her claim? Is it debatable? Is it original? Is it evaluative or analytical?
    - Note that though it is _critical_ it is not evaluative; it does not simply say that the biology textbooks are "weak" or "illogical;" it also doesn't use this rhetorical problem to take down the larger point of the biology textbooks (it's not claiming their science is faulty as a result); it is critical but also analytical -- it looks at the various parts of these texts, and builds its own original claim around those parts; it constructs a new argument   
- How does she support her claim? How does she perform close readings? How much of the text does she need to quote? How much context does she provide? Ask the class for the passage they chose
    - Note that she uses various amounts of text when necessary. But usually when she includes a larger quote, she returns to that quote from a microscopic level -- she then points the reader to the specific language she's looking at within that quote
    - Nearly every paragraph has evidence in it, mostly in the form of quotes
- How does she structure this essay?
    1. Introduction (states observation, claim, motive)
    2. Menstruation as waste vs male reproduction as remarkable
    3. Female organs as old and degenerating, why not male as wasteful also?
    4. Active description of male organs vs passive description of female organs
    5. Narrative of romance/religion/myth as a result -- men look powerful, women look weak
    6. New research, old stereotypes (various examples of how research tries to conform research narrative to existing narrative)
    7. These narratives also get at another stereotype -- female devouring spider
    8. Another potential model would be cybernetic, tho that also has drawbacks
    9. This creates a mirror effect that spits back scientific basis for cultural stereotypes
    10. Implications: if we shake these metaphors, we might better investigate nature, and rob them of their power to naturalize social conventions
- What is her motive? How does she make the clear for the readers? Why should we keep **reading** her argument?
    - "Part if my goal..." note that it is specific (not some general motive about gender or biology, but their intersection), but also shows that it is a specific problem worth investigating
- What are the implications of her argument? What might happen if we **believe** her argument?
    - We would be able to do better science and shake these stereotypes
- How does she transition between ideas on the sentence level? On the paragraph level?

#Handout checklist
- Consider checklist alongside Martin

##Workshop discussion
- Think back to times you've received feedback on papers (either from peers or teachers). What were useful comments/not useful comments? What do you look for in feedback? Free write for about 4 minutes
- Bring up workshop assignment, go over logistics

##Map our own close reading & discuss
