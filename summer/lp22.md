- P4 Proposal due this Wednesday 8/9
- P3 Final draft due Friday 8/11
- P4 Final draft due Tuesday 8/15
- Cannot accept papers after Tuesday - have to have grades in by Wednesday, so if you don't have all four papers handed in by Tuesday 8/15 at midnight, I have to automatically fail you; late papers won't get feedback, because I'll have to read them quickly for a grade

##Crawford and Hawking Discussion (20 minutes)
- Refresh our memory, collect checklist again for op-ed
- How do Crawford and Hawking compare to this list?
- Do we have a better sense of the op-ed now?

##P4 Proposal Handout
- Due on Wednesday

## Elevator Pitches (20 minutes)
- Take a few minutes to imagine you were to transform your P3 so far into an op-ed. What might that argument look like?
- Imagine you were in an elevator with an editor of a major newspaper/journal/etc and you had 1 minute to pitch your P3 op-ed version.
- What does an editor need to know, based on our list?
 - The topic of the piece – context
 - The point you’re going to make/ the angle/ is it original?
 - Do you have evidence/ a theory for what you’re trying to say?
 - Why does it matter?
 - Why do their readers need to know?

1 minute pitch to each other. Listener is editor: consider, were you sold? What else did you need to know? Confused?

Discuss (large group or pairs??) 5 mins.


Do it again but the time goes to 30 seconds.
