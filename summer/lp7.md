Didn't get any emails back, so June 23 at 6:30 is our Met visit. It will be mandatory.
Conferences on Wednesday - don't forget
Starting P2 today - we'll be talking about Sacks, then thinking about him in terms of our other readings, then we'll be revising one of our paragraphs from formal draft

##Sacks Discussion

##Conversations intersecting
- Now everyone take a couple minutes and find a moment in Sacks that reminds you of either of the two readings from P1 - Ford or Jamison
- How did it remind you of Jamison/Ford? What might we call the general conversation that both are entering? Do they take different or similar views? Are they approaching the same topic from different perspectives? Are they approaching the same topic but using different examples? Are they talking about different topics but with similar examples or frameworks?
- Ask for a volunteer - put passage on the board

##Paragraph revision
- Pair up with the person you spoke to last week about P1, so that you're working with someone who has a better sense of your topic. Select one paragraph from your draft that you're having difficulty with. Switch paragraphs. Then after, take some time to revise.
