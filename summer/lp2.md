Admin:

- Any issues with the Site? Do we all understand how to access the Site, get the readings, etc?
- Great start with the questions. In the future, keep in mind that you only need to ask one question. You don't need to break it up into Question/Answer either. You can just write everything together. I have the 250 word max so that you don't spend too much time on these; I want them to be a conversation starter, but I don't want them to take too much time.
- From now on we'll just keep rotating. So here is the current order:

Context
1. Shyan
2. Keng
Content
3. Kevin
4. Reece
5. Augustine
Form
6. Mitchell
7. Kendall
8. Isabelle

Everyone will rotate one down.

Discussion:

- We're going to try to get to everyone's questions during discussion, but that might not always happen. More than anything, I want to make sure we have a smooth and coherent discussion. So a couple rules:
- Say the name of the person who spoke before you
- Only change topics if you have a reason
So we will start with one person's question, and we'll all stay on the topic until we feel like it's been exhausted. It's okay to bring up your question if it's related -- for example, if someone asks a content question, and your formal question relates to it in some way -- but you want to have a reason for the change (not just because you want to talk about your question).
- Let's start with a content question. As we're answering, we want to keep looking at the text itself - it's okay to bring in our own opinions from time to time, but first and foremost we're interesting in what Ford himself thinks and what his ideas mean.
