- MoMA at 630 on Friday - meet in the main lobby, where you have to buy tickets, inside by the sculpture garden: phone number 267-229-3052
- Proposal due Monday

##TMR Discussion
- Do worksheet, go over it
- Emphasize that she incorporates the sources but ultimately forges her own argument - she doesn't just reiterate any one of the sources; she uses a close reading to both demonstrate and flesh out her claim further; she's engaging in the conversation, but showing how her exhibit is worth discussing in the conversation; she's not evaluating the conversation, or evaluating her sources, nor is she evaluating her exhibit; she's **analyzing** her exhibit and its relation to the ideas in the sources

##Exhibits
- For your P2 proposal, I have you consider the manageability, relevance, and ambivalence of potential exhibits.
  - Is the exhibit, or the aspect of the exhibit you are examining, too expansive or too restrictive? Can it easily be explained for an unfamiliar reader, so that you can move quickly to your interesting claims about it?
  - Does it really relate to the conversation, or do you really have to stretch to make it relate? A stretch can okay, but if you have to spend the majority of your paper simply justifying why the exhibit might be thought of as relating to artificial intelligence, and don't actually get around to fleshing out the interesting connections, then you might want to choose a more straightforward example.
  - Finally, is the exhibit ambivalent - which is to say again, can it be interpreted in multiple different ways?
- Now I have three examples of visual art up. We're going to go through all three of them and discuss the manageability, relevance, and ambivalence of each of them
    - The Dream, Dali
    - Magritte, The Lovers
    - Magritte, The Wonders of Nature
    - "Geopoliticus Child Watching the Birth of the New Man", Dali
    - Google's Deep Dream
    - Daedalus
    - Yeo, Going under the Knife
