##Admin
- deadlines reminder (say at end of class)

##P4 Workshop
- Everyone just give a brief run-down of your project (on board): what is your main topic? what will you argue? what is your exhibit? where do you want to publish it? have you made any stylistic decisions yet? any concerns/other comments/questions?
- Hand out P4 checklist (print)
- Some of these don't apply without formal drafts, but let's focus on: argument (is it original?), exhibit (is it news/relevant?), audience (does the publication make sense?)
- 10 minutes per person
