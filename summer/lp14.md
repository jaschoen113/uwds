- Check everyone has Google Cardboard
- P2 Final Draft due Sunday @ 11:59
- Make writing center appointments, I have office hours Wednesday
- Remember there is a P2 checklist under Draft Prompts if you haven't seen it yet

##P3 Prompt
- Example projects: Fight for Fallujah, video about Iraqi recapturing of Fallujah from ISIS, follows soldiers, about the problems of war time media and the potential ways VR could address those problems
- 6x9, VR film about solitary confinement, about how prisoners are usually depicted in media and how VR might provide more expansive/accurate depictions
- Most often, pick a film that either enters into another larger conversation (media and prisons, media and war, climate change, etc) - and then think about how VR film complicates that conversation, adds another layer, points out a problem, provides a potential solution etc. Could also use a VR film to think about VR more generally (more like Hayles), but that's more difficult

##Hayles
- Let's start thinking about how we can expand outward from Hayles - what kinds of other questions she raises that might be useful for branching out into our own research questions. What conversations is Hayles intersecting with? Collect on board

##Sentence Revisions
- Ask for volunteer - anyone with a sentence that either I commented as over complicated, or you think is over complicated and could be simplified?

late - kendall and augustine (excused)
absent - izzy and shyan
