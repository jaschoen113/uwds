##Jamison Discussion (35 min)

- Start with content: Keng and Reece (similar questions, both dip a bit into form but that's okay - this a piece where form and content really overlap, which makes it good for close reading). Keng start, Reece follow up. Get from point about how she uses the medical actor conceit to general content question: what does Jamison ultimately say empathy is? Is there a good kind of empathy, a bad kind? Different kinds? What's its purpose, is it effective?

Then get to form questions which are similar - Kevin and Kendall

Then context: Shyan and Mitchell

- Additional questions:  
- Where are moments of ethos, pathos, logos in this piece?
- Can we think about these rhetorical moves in relation to her larger exploration of empathy?
- How does she use pronouns to play with the idea of empathy?
- What is the effect of the script structure?
- What are some recurring images in this text?
- Why might she hold the heart surgery off from us? Does that feel reconciled? Is there a protectiveness there, as she describes?
