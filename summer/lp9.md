##Discussion of Slater

##Big map of connections
- Take a few minutes on your own to think about potential connections, free write
- Put on board

##Potential exhibit ideas
- With a partner, pick one of these connections. Think of a potential "exhibit" that you could explore via this conversation. It can be real or made up. For example, you can imagine a movie that is about x y and z, or you can just bring one up. This kind of exercise is actually useful because you often want to have an idea of what you're looking for before you just go out and hope that something intersects with what you're interested in.
