##Op-ed Prompt and checklist (10 minutes)

##NYT Piece (25 minutes)

- Read outloud the NTY piece
- Make our own Op-Ed checklist (borrow from Duke)
 - follow up questions:
  - what opinions do we respect and why? what makes for a convincing opinion? (Persuasiveness, position of the author, do they know their stuff, confidence, interesting angle, good recommendation for what we should do, itâ€™s not just analysis) what did you find in your reading of the op-ed packets?
- Put on board and discuss  
- Important to keep in mind that an opinion is just that -- it's not a fact, it's disputable. An op-ed is not a well researched paper, like P3 -- it may easily stem from research, but doesn't show its research in the piece. An op-ed is not a letter to the editor - it's not a criticism of another piece. But just because it is opinion based, doesn't mean you can just throw down your opinions without making a case for them either.

##Dyson Discussion (25 minutes)


##Relevance/Exhibit Exercise (15 minutes)
- Everyone open up some news sites (CNN, New York Times, BBC, NPR, Wired, wherever you go to for news). Don't look at the opinion/editorial pages, but instead browse through "news" sections (you can look at political, local, international, technology news - any section). Find something that is in the news today that you can imagine writing an op-ed on. You might also just select something you've read/heard about/thought about in the past couple days and remember. Try to select something that relates in any way to science/technology, but that can be very broad (it could be, for example, the internet and something else).
- Get some examples on the board. Brainstorm different op-eds that might evolve around those topics. Try to get several different kinds of opinions around the same topic.
