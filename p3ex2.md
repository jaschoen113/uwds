## Exercise 2

Find a potential virtual reality exhibit with a rich interpretive problem around which you can write a research paper. To start brainstorming research avenues, respond to the following questions:
  1. What draws you to this exhibit? What do you find surprising, intriguing, or puzzling about it?
  2. What topic does the exhibit cover? How does the exhibit cover this topic in a way another media form cannot?
  3. Consider if you were to write a historical/cultural research paper around this exhibit: what are potential historical/cultural conversations that intersect with this exhibit?
  4. Now consider if you were to write a genre research paper around this exhibit: how is the exhibit doing something formally interesting compared to other virtual reality exhibits, or at least compared to other forms of art/media? How might it push us to reconsider the relationship between art and technology?
  5. If you were to begin research around this exhibit, where might you want to start? What kind of sources do you imagine will help you consider this exhibit more productively? A conceptual framework that you can apply to this exhibit? A formal analysis of VR? An analysis of the exhibit's intersecting historical event/cultural phenomenon?
