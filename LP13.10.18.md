owl purdue transition handout?

Work on Transitions (15 minutes)
- Remember from "As a Result" craft text, Graff and Birkenstein talk about 3 ways to connect sentences:
  1. Use pointing words (transition words)
  2. Repeat key terms and phrases
  3. Repeat yourself with a difference ("in other words..." repeat )

- Have them edit transitions from OWL handout in pairs (10 minutes)
-

Workshop problems/claims (45 minutes)
- Split into groups of 3/3/4/4 (split them so they are with new people)
- Someone will time - 10 minutes per person, and I want everyone to really give 10 minutes - if you get through all of these questions, then the presenter can pose specific questions/problems they're facing (i.e. here's an example close reading, do you think this works?)
- Everyone will present:
  - What is the specific aspect of the exhibit that you're examining?
  - What question does the exhibit raise in relation to the conversation?
  - What claim are you making in response to that question?
- Everyone else will respond:
  - Is there question original, or is it simply repeating a question raised by one of the texts?
  - Is the question clearly related to the conversation and adding something new to it?
  - Is the claim evaluative or analytical? Does the claim simply seek to prove/disprove the authors we've read, or is it instead developing a new claim in relation to them?
  - Can you tell that close reading is guiding the project, or does the project still seem general and not grounded in specific analysis?
- Don't just go through and say - yes this is original, or no this isn't original - responders should also explain why it is or isn't original

- We're going to do Peer Review in class, so for Thursday instead the new assignment is revising your own work according to these workshops.
